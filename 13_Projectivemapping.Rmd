[An image of a PM]

## Example from mapping of XX 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("tempetotemperature")
tempetotemperature
table(tempetotemperature$Productname)
table(tempetotemperature$Assessor)
```

This dataset consists of 9 products evaluateed by 11 judges. 
The responses is the 2D coordinates of the procetive mapping, for each judge individually (X1, Y1, X2,..., Y11), and CATA data on 30 attribues (Miso, Soft, Bitter,..., Stout). 

## A Collated version of the data

```{r}

```

## PCA on Collated data

- downweeeigting of attributes.
- On everything with normal scaling. 
- Include judge-loadings in the output plots.
