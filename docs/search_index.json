It is used at many universities and companies since it is always updated and open source. Before staring your calculations in R you should always update the R version on your computer. You can install a graphical interface for R, called R studio. It will use the underlying version of R on your computer – so you have to have R installed too. The principles by R and R Studio are the same – BUT R Studio has a better interface for non-programmers. Both R and R Studio can be used on all types of computers. R is command-line based and it provides a wide variety of statistical methods (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, classification, clustering, …). Advanced methods are available via extension packages (more than 10.000 at the moment) Always be sure to have the latest version of both R and R Studio on your computer - update version just before you need to use the program. 2.1 How to get started - understanding R (and RStudio) A quick intro-tour of R Studio is given here: And a short intro from our courses: 2.1.1 Organise and save scripts A script is a rundown from A-Z (start to end) of data analysis. A script should be self-contained. I.e. the first lines sets the libraries and imports the data, there after you may want to wrangle the data a bit (changing features as.numeric, as.factor,…, renaming columns, etc.). Thereafter the analysis starts. Think of a script like making a meal: You need raw-materials (carrots, onions,…) - That is the data You need a kitchen - That is R as the software. You need knifes, pots and pans - That is the packages. All is needed to work and hence you need to specify them in the script. In larger projects where the same dataset may be used for several different analysis, it may be wise to have several scripts. One for importing data and modifying it (starts with import and ends with save() as an .RData file). One for descriptive analysis, one for inference, one for plots etc. So you can create a sequence of scripts to keep overview. However, this is only needed for larger projects. In small analysis you can easily include all in one script. ) Remember to put a little narrative (after a “#” at the top off you script explaining the purpose. To get started go to upper left corner and open a new script. Remember to save your script as well. After you’ve created a new script, try out our codes: 1+2 ## [1] 3 a &lt;- 2+2 b &lt;- 5+3 What happens if you write the letter a in the editor and run it? What about the letter b? a ## [1] 4 b ## [1] 8 a+b ## [1] 12 … or this one? A+B R is essentially (also a) calculator, but it is case sensitive. In the Editor: “#” is the start of a comment (means: will not evaluated/ read by the program). This is how you can make comments in your script: # I want to add 2 and 5 2+5 ## [1] 7 # whoop it is 7! “:”Generates a sequence (e.g. 1:10 is the numbers from 1 to 10) from1to10 &lt;- 1:10 from10to1 &lt;- 10:1 from1to10 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 from10to1 ## [1] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 In the Console: “&gt;” indicates that R is ready for a new code. “+” Instead of “&gt;” means that the program is waiting for you. (you probably made a mistake in the script you tried to run) – by [ESC] the “+” turns to a “&gt;” again “NA” (Not Available) is indicating a missing value “NaN” (Not a Number) is the result of an ‘illegal’ operation e.g. log(-1) Red sentences means there is an error. R will stop calculating at the first error it meets. 2.2 How to import data 2.2.1 Import data from R-package In this book several datasets are used targeting different research questions. However, a fair part of the analysis tools are common. That is, descriptive analysis, plots, response correlations etc. The data is included in the R-packgage data4consumerscience you get by running the code below. Be aware that you need devtools package to install packages from github, so you need to run both code lines. # install data-package install.packages(&#39;devtools&#39;) devtools::install_github(&#39;mortenarendt/data4consumerscience&#39;) The data is also available as excel sheets, and can be loaded using packages capable of reading from Excel. Before you start you data import, you have to make sure the data set contains all the information you need and the format of the data (columns and rows) is correct. You can import in many different ways. 2.2.2 Importing a csv file If the data is not already an csv file, but an excel file, you need to convert it: Open your Excel file, as it is in xls or xlsx format. Convert this file to csv format. NB: Some data collection tools will provide you with your data in csv and some xlsx/xls format. In Excel, you choose the “save as” and then choose *.csv. Then move in to R, and write: DATASET1 &lt;- read.csv2(file.choose()) The file.choose() function makes you point towards the file you want. You can also simply write the path to the file directly. Actually, by using the file.choose() the first time you import data will prombt the path, and you can simply copy paste this from the console to your script avoiding point and click every time you want to analyse these data. DATASET1 &lt;- read.csv2(&#39;~/path/to/the/data/myfile.csv&#39;) You decide the names/titles of your datasets and models, just do not use other signs than “.” and avoid non-English letters. We called it “DATASET1”. R will open a new window (sometimes hidden behind your other open windows), open the window to choose the wanted csv file. The data set will now also appear in the upper right corner as a line. If you double click a data set in this box, it will open in the editor window You can import any *.csv format dataset, when you try it out. Trouble shooting: * Try new csv format in Excel when saving the file in csv format * Try to write read.csv(file.choose()) instead * Try another import function (see below) 2.2.3 Importing an Excel file/sheet If you have data as excel, you may utilize packages for directly importing, without the need to convert to csv. If your Excel file contains more than one sheet, you have to import each sheet separately. Here we use the package readxl with the function read_excel. If the data is not in the same folder as your script, then include the path to the data, or move the data to the script’s location. The example below imports from an excel file ( DatasetRbook.xlsx) a sheet (named e.g. BuffetData ), positioned in a folder (named data ) in the current position. You can download this dataset from here. When you have to find the path for the file on your computer, you place your cursor within the ’’ in the command and click the tabulator button. Your computer files will appear, and you can find the path for your file easily. If you cannot find the path, try to use the file.choose() command to find the file, and then copy paste the path from the Console (where you find your output). library(readxl) BuffetConsumption &lt;- read_excel(&#39;./data/DatasetRbook.xlsx&#39;,sheet = &#39;BuffetData&#39;) BuffetSurvey &lt;- read_excel(&#39;./data/DatasetRbook.xlsx&#39;,sheet = &#39;BuffetSurvey&#39;) The first part of the model sentence is what we want to call our dataset, here we chose “BuffetConsumption” in the first line (that is the same as the sheet in the Excel file for simplicity). You decide the names/titles of your datasets and model, just do not use other signs than “.” and avoid non-English letters. Try to import sheets from an excel file. BuffetConsumption is consumption data in grams from a buffet. The data is from 16 different persons, who came on Day 1 and Day 2 to eat Pasta with legumes and/or Pasta with mushroom. In the dataset, there is one line per buffet station per participant per experimental day. BuffetSurvey is survey data collected in SurveyXact. The dataset contains data on liking, motivation, choices etc. linked to the particular buffet data. Survey could also contain demographics for the participants such as age, gender, eating habits etc. These are general and different from the former, in that they have nothing to do with the current buffet. This type of data is not included in the SurveyData. 2.2.4 Clipboard import Last resort is to import via your clipboard. Go to Excel and mark the data you want to import. Make sure there are headings in the data you have marked. Copy the marked data to the clipboard. Go to the Editor and write the following command line: DATASET2 &lt;- read.table(file=&quot;clipboard&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) Meaning read the table you saved in your clipboard and save it as the name “DATASET2” (remember you choose this name). The data has headers and should be separated in cells. Regardless of importation method – the dataset will appear in the upper right corner environment as a line, please check it looks correct. You can import from any Excel dataset, when you try it out. 2.2.5 Looking at the imported elements Have a look at the imported elements to ensure that indeed, they mimic the Excel sheets. Use the functions head(), str() and View() is your tools. They will give you the headlines in your data, how your variables are categorized and open the dataset in a new tab. head(BuffetConsumption) str(BuffetConsumption) View(BuffetConsumption) Try to use the BuffetConsumption dataset. If it does not look as expected, try to import it again using a different method. 2.2.6 Numbers and factors - changing categorisation During the import R will automatically categorise your variables: if they are read as numbers or letters. For instance, if day of the experiment is called 1 and 2 in the data file and is then read as numeric (num). As Day 2 is not double the value of Day 1, we need to change this variable into a factor (Factor) or character (chr). Use the str() function to check your variables before your change them. You transform your variables using as.numeric() or as.character(). BuffetConsumption$Day&lt;-as.factor(BuffetConsumption$Day) Meaning take the variable Day in the dataset you called BuffetConsumption, make it a factor and put it into the same variable name (overwrites it). If you want to have a new variable coded and then keep the old one, simply just give it a new name, e.g. “DayFactor”. The dataset will then be extended with one variable, but sometimes it is nice to have both versions. BuffetConsumption$DayFactor&lt;-as.factor(BuffetConsumption$Day) 2.3 How to edit and merge datasets Sometimes you have to merge two data sets. This is needed if you have for instance consumption data in one Excel sheet and survey data in another Excel sheet. Setup the data in Excel such that they match the below in terms of format. What is important is: First row is used on headings and none of these are repeated. I.e. all unique within a sheet Data comes from row 2 and then on to the right All rows should contain data (NB: empty cell is also data, e.g. an unanswered questions), so all empty rows are removed (not cells) Headings between sheets referring to the same: e.g. participant ID should have exactly similar heading If you have calculated stuff within Excel such as a sum of the numbers in a column, then these should be removed from the sheet. It is not data! We suggest that you keep both the original version of the data as a sheet, and the ready-to-import version as a sheet, so you do not accidentally delete data. 2.3.0.1 Edit using Tidyverse The Consumption data is optimal as is. We have the data as long format with all repsonses in one coloumn and then the next columns clarifying the design, time, type, person etc. However the Survey data is not optimal directly. We need to revert the data to both long and wide format. There are several ways to do this, including editing in Excel. Here we show how it can be done in R using tidyverse. Tidyverse is a larger framework. For introduction see: and maybe visit tidyverse-homepage for resources. library(tidyverse) Surveylong &lt;- BuffetSurvey %&gt;% gather(question,answ, `Pasta with legumes is visually appealing to me. `: `I like the taste of pasta with mushrooms! `) Surveywide &lt;- Surveylong %&gt;% spread(question,answnum) The code above does exactly that, with Surveylong and Surveywide as the resulting data sets. Try to compare BuffetSurvey with Surveywide - did we already have a wide version of the dataset? What is also introduced here is the pipe operator %&gt;%. It originates from the dplyr-package inside the tidyverse-package, and is a handy tool for data manipulation. The way it works is, that whatever is written on the right side of the operator, will be used as the first argument in the function written on the left side of the operator. This means, that x %&gt;% f(y) will result in f(x,y) - or in our case: BuffetSurvey %&gt;% gather(question,answ, Pasta with legumes is visually appealing to me.:I like the taste of pasta with mushrooms!) will be equal to: gather(BuffetSurvey,question,answ, Pasta with legumes is visually appealing to me.: I like the taste of pasta with mushrooms!) The idea is then to “chain” (or “pipe” as it is also known) %&gt;% together line after line, using different functions in a sequence, which makes the code more readable and often shorter as well. gather will lengthen the data, by stacking the columns we specified on top of each other, resulting in each row being one single answer to one of the 4 questions. The answer will be in the answ-column, the question in the question-column, and the rest of the columns can then be used to e.g. group the data. spread will do the opposite as gather, and spread one column in several columns depending on what the columns contains. In our case the question-column in spread into 4 columns, one for each question from the survey, with the numerical values of the answers as their values. You might have also noticed, that when a variable name contains a space, R needs help understanding that this is indeed a variable. Different symbols are added, and while you CAN write everything just the way R know how to read it, there is an easier way to make sure that everything is written correctly. You can call the variables from the data frame that they originate from, using “dataframe$” and then hit TAB. A list of the variables of which the data frame consist will appear, and from this you can choose the right one - always spelled correctly, and the way R knows how the interpret it. 2.3.0.2 Merging datasets For the sake of being able to compare consumption (obtained from buffet data) with liking and motives (obtained from the survey data) these data frames needs to be merged. There are several merge options, here we use left_join() but full_join() and right_join() might more suited in some situations - depending on which data set you want to have appear first, and how you want to merge them. If you feel more comfortable with Excel, you can also merge the two data frames in one Excel sheet before importing it to R. 2.3.0.2.1 Adding survey to buffets Merging should be done such that Person and Day in each separate sheet match. If you additionally have demographic data (gender, age, etc.) then obviously only Person should match, as the data is constant over Days. Buffet_plus_survey &lt;- BuffetConsumption %&gt;% left_join(Surveywide, by = c(&#39;Person&#39;,&#39;Day&#39;)) left_join checks in Surveywide and BuffetConsumption in columns “Person” and “Day”, and will add rows from Surveywide to BuffetConsumption when values in both columns are the same. 2.3.0.2.2 Adding buffet to survey Similarly, merging should be done such that Person and Day match. If you additionally have demographic data (gender, age, etc.) then obviously only Person should match, as the data is constant over Days. Further, we use the long format of the survey data here. Surveylong_buffet &lt;- Surveylong %&gt;% left_join(BuffetConsumption, by = c(&#39;Person&#39;,&#39;Day&#39;)) 2.4 How to save the data Use save.image() to save everything in the Environment (all variables shown in the “Environment”-tab in the upper right corner of RStudio), or use save() to specify which elements to save using the “list”-input. # Saving everything to the folder of your choice save.image(file = &#39;./data/FolderYouWantToSaveYourProjectTo/AllMyData.RData&#39;) # Saving just the specified datasets and other elements to your folder of choice save(file = &#39;./data/FolderYouWantToSaveYourProjectTo/SomeOfMyData.RData&#39;, list = c(&#39;Survey&#39;,&#39;Surveylong_buffet&#39;,&#39;Surveylong&#39;,&#39;Buffet_survey&#39;&#39;)) 2.5 How to export data / results You can export any data frame from R to excel (for instance using the rio package), as well as saving it as .RData for further analysis. This can obviously be used for exporting your data after some modifications. BUT it is also very useful for exporting data frames with results from analysis. When exporting data, it is also important to tell R where to place the exported file. You do this by specifying the path to the desired folder, followed by the name that you choose for the exported file (often it makes sense to choose the same name as the data frame in R). It is also important to specify the file-extension, to ensure that you create the right file type - in this case .xlsx, but rio can also export to other formats such as .txt or .csv. # export one data frame rio::export(Surveylong_buffet,file = &#39;./data/YourFolderForNiceTables/Surveylong_buffet.xlsx&#39;) 2.6 Ready for analysis Once you have saved the data, you can simply load the data directly, and you do not need to do the import-setup every time you want to do an analysis on the data. This part is not a part of the data import, but it is a good idea just to check that the data indeed is setup as expected. load(&#39;./data/FolderWhereYourDataAreStored/YourData.RData&#39;) "],["libraries.html", "Chapter 3 Libraries", " Chapter 3 Libraries R comes with a bit of functionality. However, most of the useful tools in R is distributed as packages. There are +10.000 package for R, so it is a jungle to figure out what the most easy solution to your problem at hand is. However, the teams who have made tidyverse and ggplot2 etc. have made a lot of things much more easy, and we strongly rely on their tools and routines in data analysis. To install packages from CRAN (the main repo where R-packages are distributed) install.packages(&#39;SomePackageName&#39;) To install packages from github (the online place where all the development and general code sharing is distributed) devtools::install_github(&#39;DeveloperName/SomePackageName&#39;) To make packages available within your analysis use library(), or use the package name followed by :: and the function. The library function will activate the installed package. library(ggplot2) ggplot2::qplot(rnorm(100)) # example of a function call without library&#39;ing the package. Tidyverse is a large framework build to handle and manipulate data in a variety of different ways. An example of said manipulation is shown in chapter 1 under Edit using Tidyverse.

"],["descriptive-statistics.html", "Chapter 4 Descriptive statistics 4.1 Descriptives for a continuous variable 4.2 Distributions of count data 4.3 Aggregate 4.4 Tidyverse", " Chapter 4 Descriptive statistics In this Chapter we will go through the main elements of descriptive statistics. In principle, descriptive statistics is the act of taking a bunch of data and represent them in few numbers, such as mean, median, standard deviation etc. For a more thorough introduction you can check every introductory stats book: The first couple of chapters will cover this. For examples in this chapter we will use two datasets: chili: where and green tea in combination is added to meals and the resulting ad-libitum consumption is recorded, and pasta which is iBuffet data with a survey of preferences for each Person. The data is made available by: library(data4consumerscience) data(chili) data(pasta) # we subset to only have the &quot;Pasta with legumes&quot; data. pasta &lt;- pasta[pasta$StationName==&#39;Pasta with legumes&#39;,] If you do not have imported the data4consumerscience package see: Import data from R-package If you need to import data see: How to import data 4.1 Descriptives for a continuous variable Below we will first explain the different descriptive measures, and then describe calculations of them. Continuous variables could be sensory scores (e.g. 15 cm continuous line scale), consumption data (in gram) or liking scores (e.g. on a scale from 1 to 9). 4.1.1 Mean / median Here you get an introduction to statistics, descriptive statistics and the terms average/mean and median: 4.1.2 Variance Here you get an introduction to variance: 4.1.3 Standard deviation Here you get an introduction to the standard deviation: 4.1.4 Calculations For the calculations, we use the chili dataset. To compute mean, median, variance, standard deviation, etc. there are functions working directly on vectors: mean(chili$Totalg) ## [1] 1699.977 median(chili$Totalg) ## [1] 1740.4 var(chili$Totalg) ## [1] 211259 sd(chili$Totalg) ## [1] 459.6292 IQR(chili$Totalg) ## [1] 660.6 summary(chili$Totalg) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 849.6 1289.1 1740.4 1700.0 1949.7 2905.2 4.2 Distributions of count data If the response can take certain values or categories, then the table function is good in getting how many observations there are within a given vector, or combinations of several vectors. table(pasta$I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes) ## ## Disagree More or less disagree ## 1 3 ## Neither agree nor disagree More or less agree ## 2 5 ## Agree Strongly agree ## 8 11 table(pasta$I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes, pasta$Did_you_consider_the_proteincontent_of_the_dishes_you_choose) ## ## No Yes ## Disagree 0 1 ## More or less disagree 2 1 ## Neither agree nor disagree 1 1 ## More or less agree 1 4 ## Agree 0 8 ## Strongly agree 5 6 You see that most of the answers are in agreement with question, and that there are no observations in the Strongly disagree category. This is a very high level representation, and we usually want to compare means (or other metrics) between different groups. That is to compute descriptive statistics for subsets of the data. There are two ways to do this. Either using the aggregate() function or use the group_by() and summarize() from the tidyverse framework. Below both is shown to characterize Totalg on each of the products 4.3 Aggregate aggregate(chili$Totalg,by = list(chili$Treatment),FUN = mean) ## Group.1 x ## 1 Capsaicin 1716.195 ## 2 Green tea 1664.504 ## 3 CH19 1708.977 ## 4 Capsaicin+ Green tea 1649.495 ## 5 placebo 1759.754 aggregate(chili$Totalg,by = list(chili$Treatment),FUN = sd) ## Group.1 x ## 1 Capsaicin 473.1042 ## 2 Green tea 462.2564 ## 3 CH19 452.1225 ## 4 Capsaicin+ Green tea 450.3940 ## 5 placebo 468.4211 aggregate() will apply a function to a column or data set, using the list provided to group the column or dataset. In our case, the column we want to apply our function to is chili$Totalg, the functions are FUN = mean or FUN = sd (finding the mean and standard deviation, respectively) and the column we use for grouping the data is chili$Treatment. This results in a data frame, where one column shows each unique group in chili$Treatment, and another column shows the mean or standard deviation of chili$Totalg corresponding to each group. 4.4 Tidyverse library(tidyverse) tb &lt;- chili %&gt;% group_by(Treatment) %&gt;% # specify which grouping vector to use summarise(n = n(), # compute n mn = mean(Totalg), # compute mean s = sd(Totalg), # compute s q1 = quantile(Totalg,0.25), # compute lower 25% quartile q3 = quantile(Totalg,0.75)) # compute upper 75% quartile tb ## # A tibble: 5 × 6 ## Treatment n mn s q1 q3 ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Capsaicin 55 1716. 473. 1314. 1943. ## 2 Green tea 53 1665. 462. 1213. 1912. ## 3 CH19 54 1709. 452. 1323. 1959. ## 4 Capsaicin+ Green tea 54 1649. 450. 1271. 1906. ## 5 placebo 54 1760. 468. 1302. 1992 group_by will use the column specified to group the data, and the groups are then used when further manipulation is applied to the data frame. summarise will create a summary of the input data, with the columns specified in the code, calculation the statistics also written in the code (e.g. mn = mean(Totalg) will create a column with the mean of Totalg, for each group in Treatment, as specified by group_by()).

Further, lets print the results in a nice looking table using kable() from the knitr package. library(knitr) kable(tb, caption = &#39;some caption&#39;, digits = 0, format = &#39;simple&#39;) Table 4.1: some caption Treatment n mn s q1 q3 Capsaicin 55 1716 473 1314 1943 Green tea 53 1665 462 1213 1912 CH19 54 1709 452 1323 1959 Capsaicin+ Green tea 54 1649 450 1271 1906 placebo 54 1760 468 1302 1992 … and a plot of it: tb %&gt;% ggplot(data = ., aes(Treatment,mn, ymin = q1, ymax = q3)) + geom_point() + geom_errorbar() More information on plotting will come in a future chapter (see Plotting data). But try and see if you can make sense of the inputs, and what they correspond to in the plot. "],["plotting-data.html", "Chapter 5 Plotting data 5.1 Histograms and boxplots 5.2 Scatter plots 5.3 How to export plots", " Chapter 5 Plotting data Visualizing data is of utmost importance. Especially, looking at the raw data will enable you to point towards outliers and tendencies which may be lost when representing the data with descriptive statistics. ggplot2 is a wide spread library for plotting data and used by a lot of users. Check it out on videos: There is a very condensed cheat-sheet for ggplot2 on RStudios webpage Loading the needed datasets chili and pasta: library(data4consumerscience) data(chili) data(pasta) # we subset to only have the &quot;Pasta with legumes&quot; data. pasta &lt;- pasta[pasta$StationName==&#39;Pasta with legumes&#39;,] 5.1 Histograms and boxplots To show the total consumption a histogram is useful library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = AdLibg)) + geom_histogram() The plot reveals a bi-modal distribution with an upper tail. These observations comes from 5 different treatments, 27 different judges and at 10 test days. We can infer this using a boxplot with jittered raw data on top. Per treatment: ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Treatment, y = AdLibg)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter() Per Judge: ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = factor(Judge), y = AdLibg)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter() None of these explains the bi-modality seen in the histogram. However, we can combine test-day information, which essentially is reflecting whether it is first or second trial splitting at day 5: (TestDay&gt;5) ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = factor(Judge), y = AdLibg, color = factor(TestDay&gt;5))) + geom_boxplot(aes(group = factor(Judge))) + geom_jitter() This coloring shows a clear difference between trials, which explains the bi-modal distribution. It also explains why the two modes of the distribution are overlapping, and why the distribution is skewed. Because while most judges have consumed more during the first trial, some judges did the opposite - higher consumption during the second trial. 5.2 Scatter plots Lets plot the consumption (AdLibg) as a function of LikingAppearance, and add a tendency line: ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = LikingAppearance, y = AdLibg)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39;) This plot shows AdLibg on the y-axis plotted against LikingApperance on the x-axis, with “stat_smooth()” adding a tendency line. Try adding “method = lm” inside the brackets of stat_smooth(), and see how the line changes. Now, lets funk this up by splitting into test-days and get colors according to product: ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg, color = Treatment)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39;, se = F, method = lm) + facet_wrap(~ TestDay&gt;5) The plot shows, that the tendency of food intake increasing with increased hunger, is true for all treatments, as well as duriung both trial days. 5.3 How to export plots The plots shown in the Plots pane (lower right of RStudio) can be saved using the Export bottom. You can also save the plots to a file using the ggsave() function. If you run ggsave() without specifying which plot to export, it will use the latest. You can also directly specify the plot to export: myplot &lt;- ggplot(data = chili, aes(Hunger,AdLibg, color = Treatment)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(se = F, method = lm) + facet_wrap(~ TestDay&gt;5) ggsave(&#39;./data/YourFolderForNicePlots/hunger_vs_consumption.pdf&#39;,myplot) ggsave() supports different formats (.png, .tiff, .pdf,…) and further allows for editing the size (height = , width = ).

In principle these response variables can be of any nature (continuous, ordinal, binary), but mostly PCA is used for analysis of continuous. In this book Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used several times. This chapter will shortly explain the theory behind PCA and the interpretation of relevant plots. PCA is a tool for looking a correlation structure between variables, and groupings of samples. All through visualizations. Check out youtube on the subject for an introduction. A conceptual introduction is given here: A bit of math The multivariate dataset is organized in a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) with \\(n\\) samples and \\(p\\) variables. This matrix is factorized into so called scores (\\(\\mathbf{T}\\)) and loadings (\\(\\mathbf{P}\\)). \\[ \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{P} + \\mathbf{E} \\] This estimation is done such that the residuals (\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)) is minimized in a least squares sense. The upside of using PCA is that we characterize the sample distribution (what is similar and different) using plots of \\(\\mathbf{T}\\), and the correlation of the responses using plots of \\(\\mathbf{P}\\). In addition to PCA there exists a range of methods for factorizing multivariate datasets including Partial Least Squares (PLS), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Correspondence Analysis (CA), Redundancy Analysis (RA), and a lot more. Conceptually, all these methods aims to make a latent-factor model just like PCA, and hence understanding the idea and especially how PCA is used, opens up for using a wide range of variants. 6.1 Interpreting model output For calculating a PCA model, we will use the dataset beef. It is a sensory descriptive profile on vacuum packed beef steaks heat treated in water baths at different temperatures for different times (sous vide) In total 12 combinations. The samples are coded as e.g. 56-03, meaning the sample has been treated for 56 degrees for 3 hours. There are 10 assessors in the panel, four sensory repetitions and 22 attrributes (A-Brownsurface to T-Salt). The first 3 colooumns of the dataset is used for the design. The PCA is computed on the response variables only library(data4consumerscience) data(beef) mdlPCA &lt;- prcomp(beef[,4:25], scale. = T) 6.1.1 Biplot The ggbiplot package (and function) is a need tool to plot the PCA model. Installation of this is done by: devtools::install_github(&#39;vqv/ggbiplot&#39;) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA) The PCA tries to capture the maximum structure of the data in a few dimensions called principal components (PC1, PC2,…). The arrows and labels reflects the correlation structure between the responses. I.e we see that the Bouillon characteristics is correlated and explains PC2, while textural properties like Rubberband, Chewtime is correlated, and oppositely correlated of Tender, and collectively explains PC1. We can deecorate the scores with design information, such as beef type as well as judge ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = beef$ProductName, ellipse = T) All though this plot is a bit messy, we see that higher temperature promotes higher position on PC2: I.e. moving from bloody to bouillon. While PC1 to some extend captures trends in cooking time. ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = beef$Assessor, ellipse = T) Coloring according to judge reveal that judge A04 is low in range (variance), and hence do not utilize the entire response scale, A03 tends to rate higher on rubberband, chewtime, bloodmetal, etc. especilly compared to A10, which is higher in bouillon / PC2. This plot indicates how well trained the panel is, as we optimally have only smaller impact of the individual judges. "],["introduction-to-linear-and-mixed-models.html", "Chapter 7 Introduction to linear and mixed models 7.1 What is a linear model? 7.2 Normal and Mixed models", " Chapter 7 Introduction to linear and mixed models 7.1 What is a linear model? Linear models are on of the most used statistical methods. It consists of a wide range of models including regression, multiple-regression, ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA) type models etc. The definition is that the response is linear in the parameters. If \\(y\\) is the response, and \\(x\\) is the predictor, then both of the models below is linear models \\[y = a + b\\cdot x + e\\] \\[y = a + b\\cdot x + c\\cdot x^2 + e\\] Here you see that the response is linear in the parameters \\(a,b,c\\). I.e. it has nothing to do with being linear in the predictor. 7.2 Normal and Mixed models 7.2.1 Normal model In a normal linear model such as: \\[y = a + b\\cdot x + e\\] The assumption is that the uncertainty is captured by one entry, namely the residuals (\\(e\\)). For instance, the relation between Hunger and the intake AdLibg of dishes with Capsaicin can be visualized and modelled by: library(data4consumerscience) data(chili) x &lt;- chili %&gt;% # only include a single treatment filter(Treatment==&#39;Capsaicin&#39;) %&gt;% # only include the first trial for each judge filter(!duplicated(Judge)) ggplot(data = x, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = lm, se = F) Naturally, the more hungry, the higher the intake. A model describing this relation: mdl &lt;- lm(data = x, AdLibg~Hunger) summary(mdl) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = AdLibg ~ Hunger, data = x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -347.34 -106.69 -18.06 133.88 341.60 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Further, at Hunger=0 the intake is \\(379.8g\\). Furhter, we see that this relation is significant \\(p = 0.0036\\). More details on the use of linear models in R and how-to can be viewed in these videos: 7.2.2 Mixed model A mixed model refers to the situation, where more than one part of the model is handling the uncertainty. For instance, in the chili data set there are two instances for each judge, and hence the uncertainty can be split into between judges and within judged. In this plot the intake is shown across products (Treatment) and labelled with the Judge number. For instance, Judge 1 is in general high and 24 generally low. Further, the plot is splitted according to the two test-repetition (First: TestDays = 1,..,5, Second: TestDays = 6,..,10). This structure is encoded in the modelling. ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg, color = Treatment, label = Judge)) + geom_text() + stat_smooth(method = lm, se = F) + facet_wrap(~TestDay&gt;5) library(lme4) library(lmerTest) chili$TestDay2 &lt;- factor(chili$TestDay&gt;5) # adding a new testday variable mdlmix &lt;- lmer(data = chili, AdLibg ~ Hunger*Treatment + (1|Judge) + (1|(TestDay2))) summary(mdlmix) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite&#39;s method [ ## lmerModLmerTest] ## Formula: AdLibg ~ Hunger * Treatment + (1 | Judge) + (1 | (TestDay2)) ## Data: chili ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 3407.9 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.78687 -0.60988 0.01365 0.51858 2.85224 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## Judge (Intercept) 27011 164.35 ## (TestDay2) (Intercept) 2974 54.53 ## Residual 16870 129.89 ## Number of obs: 269, groups: Judge, 27; (TestDay2), 2 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.

Usually, such data is organized in a matrix where each row corresponds to the evaluation of one product by one respondent (sensory panelist, consumer or other). The columns describe the product ID/properties, respondent number and the attributes. Say you for instance have 26 participants and 4 products, and further that all products are evaluated by all respondents once on 13 attributes. Your data matrix would then have 104 rows and 13 columns (with responses) and additionally columns indicating respondent, product, record id, date, etc. In the CATA section of this book, we will use a data set with Beer. The data originates from Giacalone, Bredie, and Frøst (2013). They consist of evaluation of six different commercial beers from Danish craft brewers evaluated by \\(160\\) consumers on a range of different questions: Sensory properties: the consumers’ response to 27 sensory descriptors (s_descriptor), some of which are super-ordinate and others more detailed. Includes information about beer and respondent. One line for each beer (6) x consumer (160) . This dataset is called beercata. Background information: a range of questions about consumers’ demography, food neophobia, beer knowledge and use, also including appropriateness ratings (a descriptor) for 27 sensory descriptors on a 7-points scale (e.g. how appropriate do you think it is for a beer to be bitter?). The two semantic anchors were 1 = not at all appropriate and 7 = extremely appropriate. This dataset is called beerbackground. Hedonics: Their hedonic responses to the beer on a 7-point hedonic scale (1-7). This dataset is called beerliking. 8.1 Importing and looking at the beer data The data appear as a part of the data4consumerscience package (see Import data from R-package) We first have to import or load the data. Here is the import, remember to change the path for the Excel file to match your own settings: library(readxl) beercata &lt;- read_excel(&#39;DatasetRbook.xlsx&#39;,sheet = &#39;BeerCATA&#39;) Beerbackground &lt;- read_excel(&#39;DatasetRbook.xlsx&#39;,sheet = &#39;BeerBackground&#39;) beerliking &lt;- read_excel(&#39;DatasetRbook.xlsx&#39;,sheet = &#39;BeerLiking&#39;) The packages you need to run the analyses are activated with the library function and the package name.

Gather all the variables from S_Flower to S_Vinous and call them attrib. Group all data by the Beer variable (sample name column) and attrib (all of our CATA variables), then sum up the values (val) and call them n. Make a table of attrib and n. Save it all as the new name beercatasum. Then finally shown us the new data set. … and visualized by for instance a barplot. # summary counts over attribute beercatasum %&gt;% gather(attrib, n, S_Aromatic:S_Warming) %&gt;% ggplot(data = ., aes(x = attrib, y = n, fill = Beer)) + geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;, position = position_dodge()) + coord_flip() To plot all attributes, we need a long data format (discussed in more detail in chapter 1 in the section Edit using Tidyverse). gather creates the long format, which is then added as the first input in the plot (represented by “.”). The different attributes are depicted on the x-axis, with the summed up values grouped by beer-type on the y-axis. The last line (coord_flip()) flips the plot, to make the attributes more readable. For more plot types go to the Chapter on Plotting data. 8.3 Cochran’s Q test Cochran’s Q test is a statistical test for the comparison of several products, where the response is binary, and there is repeated responses across several judges. We need the package RVAideMemoire.The data needs to be structured as the beercata is. We can only run the model independently for one variable at a time. For one response variable: S_Flowers library(RVAideMemoire) m &lt;- cochran.qtest(S_Flowers ~ Beer | Consumer.ID, data = beercata) m ## ## Cochran&#39;s Q test ## ## data: S_Flowers by Beer, block = Consumer.ID ## Q = 63.252, df = 5, p-value = 2.581e-12 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in probabilities is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## proba in group &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 0.02500 0.28750 0.16875 0.10625 0.13750 ## &lt;NA&gt; ## 0.28125 The p.value is strongly significant, indicating that we cannot assume the same level of S_Flower in all beers. I.e. the beers seems different based on this characteristics. This is in agreement with the barplot above, where S_Flower is high in NY Lager and really low for Brown ale. But in reality we only know that the beers are different overall, not which specific beers that are different. For this we need at post hoc test. 8.3.1 Post hoc test As we observe differences based on this attribute, we pursue the question on which products stick out? And are there products which are similar? This is done by pairwise comparisons, for this we need the package rcompanion: library(rcompanion) PT = pairwiseMcnemar(S_Flowers ~ Beer | Consumer.ID, data = beercata, test = &quot;permutation&quot;, method = &quot;fdr&quot;, digits = 3) PT$Pairwise %&gt;% arrange(-abs(as.numeric(Z))) %&gt;% data.frame() ## Comparison Z p.value p.adjust ## 1 Brown Ale - NY Lager = 0 -6.48 9.13e-11 1.37e-09 ## 2 Brown Ale - Wheat IPA = 0 -5.86 4.71e-09 3.53e-08 ## 3 Brown Ale - Porse Bock = 0 -4.27 1.95e-05 9.75e-05 ## 4 NY Lager - Ravnsborg Red = 0 4.14 3.43e-05 1.29e-04 ## 5 Ravnsborg Red - Wheat IPA = 0 -3.96 7.5e-05 2.25e-04 ## 6 NY Lager - River Beer = 0 3.54 0.000402 8.48e-04 ## 7 Brown Ale - River Beer = 0 -3.53 0.000415 8.48e-04 ## 8 River Beer - Wheat IPA = 0 -3.51 0.000452 8.48e-04 ## 9 Brown Ale - Ravnsborg Red = 0 -2.98 0.00286 4.77e-03 ## 10 NY Lager - Porse Bock = 0 2.52 0.0118 1.77e-02 ## 11 Porse Bock - Wheat IPA = 0 -2.36 0.0181 2.47e-02 ## 12 Porse Bock - Ravnsborg Red = 0 1.54 0.123 1.54e-01 ## 13 Porse Bock - River Beer = 0 0.845 0.398 4.26e-01 ## 14 Ravnsborg Red - River Beer = 0 -0.845 0.398 4.26e-01 ## 15 NY Lager - Wheat IPA = 0 0.135 0.893 8.93e-01 The first part of the code is conducting the Post hoc test, whereas the last part of the code sorts the table from highest to lowest numerical value of Z. This is done to ease the interpretation of the table. Most products are significantly different, while Porse Bock and Ravnsborg Red are fairly alike. This is determined by looking at the adjusted p-value, and checking whether it is exceed the desired \\[\\alpha\\]-level. The adjusted p-values are used, as they have been adjusted to compensate for the fact that multiple pairwise comparisons are conducted. 8.3.2 For all attributes in one run (nice to know) We use the packages tidyverse and broom for this, but need a function capable of handling Cochran’s Q-test outputs. library(broom) tidy.RVtest &lt;- function(m){ r &lt;- data.frame(statistic = m$statistic,df = m$parameter, p.value= m$p.value, method = m$method.test) return(r) } tb_cochran &lt;- beercata %&gt;% gather(attrib, val, S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %&gt;% group_by(attrib) %&gt;% do(cochran.qtest(val ~ Beer | Consumer.ID, data = .) %&gt;% tidy) tb_cochran %&gt;% arrange(p.value) ## # A tibble: 27 × 5 ## # Groups: attrib [27] ## attrib statistic df p.value method ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 S_Beans 114. 5 7.19e-23 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 2 S_Caramel 108. 5 1.08e-21 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 3 S_Flowers 63.3 5 2.58e-12 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 4 S_Aromatic 45.8 5 9.90e- 9 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 5 S_Sweet 36.3 5 8.24e- 7 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 6 S_Warming 35.9 5 1.01e- 6 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 7 S_Smoked 33.9 5 2.47e- 6 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 8 S_Liquor 33.9 5 2.55e- 6 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 9 S_Citrus fruit 29.4 5 1.96e- 5 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## 10 S_Dried fruit 26.0 5 8.81e- 5 Cochran&#39;s Q test ## # … with 17 more rows Again the table is sorted with the most sigficant at the top, and the least significant at the bottom. This output indicates that S_Beans is the most discriminatory attribute, while S_Pungent is the least. For the pairwise comparisons, please apply the code for the Tukey test above per attribute. 8.4 PCA on CATA data For an introduction PCA, please go to the Chapter Introduction to PCA and multivariate data in the first part of the book. A PCA on the summed CATA counts will reveal the attributes associated with the individual products: mdlPCA &lt;- prcomp(beercatasum[,-1], scale. = T) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, labels = beercatasum$Beer) The figure shows the scores (beers, in black) and loadings (sensory descriptors, dark red) from the PCA’s first two components. These two components describe 45.5% + 27.2% = 72.7% of the total variance in the summed data. From the positions of the beers it is clear that the beers are similar in three pairs – Brown Ale and Ravnsborg Red, left side of panel: Porse Bock and River Beer, upper right side; NY Lager and Wheat IPA, lower right part of panel. The sensory descriptors S_Beans, Dried fruit, Caramel, Warming, Aromatic etc. are all is associated to the beer Brown ale, while Berries, Herb_Savory, Dessert, Pungent etc. is characteristic for Wheat IPA, and to some degree also NY Lager. Sour and Sparkling are the two descriptors that are most frequently mentioned for River Beer and also Porse Bock. You can check the analysis by cross checking with the summed CATA table. Descriptors that are located very close to each other show very similar patterns of response, i.e. they are highly correlated. An example is Caramel and Warming, which do not have same summed scores but the same pattern of high and low across samples. From the figure we can extract the overall conclusion of similarity and differences among samples, but we need Cochran’s Q to describe which descriptors that can be used to statistically separate the samples, and which samples are different for said descriptor. "],["hedonic-rating-e.g.html", "Chapter 9 Hedonic rating (e.g. liking scores) 9.1 Plotting liking scores 9.2 Simple mixed models 9.3 Multivariable models", " Chapter 9 Hedonic rating (e.g. liking scores) An evaluation of how much we like a food or drink is a hedonic response. Often this is given as a number on a scale, or by checking a category box with a description, such as the 9-point hedonic scale. For data analysis, the boxes are made numerical, with the assumption the there is equidistance between the meaning of the category labels, i.e dislike extremely and dislike very much is as different as dislike a little and neutral. The original English language anchors for the 9-point hedonic scale was develop and validated on tests using approximately 5500 American soldiers in the beginning of the 1950’s (Lawless &amp; Heymann, Chapter 7 Scaling, 2010). There are a number of validated scales, including visual smiley scales for children. Dependent on the respondent 5, 7 or 9 point scales are used. Most often we want to know if the hedonic response is significantly different (not just different by chance) depending on the samples. We might also want to know if other factors have an influence on the hedonic rating. e.g. household income or sex. We also want to know what are the actual differences are in numerical size. All this requires different statistical estimates. 9.1 Plotting liking scores For the beer data we have the liking in a long matrix. library(data4consumerscience) library(ggplot2) data(beerliking) A histogram of the likings shows that some are symmetric ( NY Lager, River Beer and to some extend Porse Bock), while Brown Ale and Ravnsborg Red is skeew, and Wheat IPA is uniform. ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Liking)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~Beer) 9.2 Simple mixed models In the following plot each liking score is connected within consumer across the beer types. The facet (according to Age) is just to avoid overplotting. Here, there is a trend towards, if you rate one beer high, the other likings within that consumer will also be high. ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Beer,Liking, group = Consumer.ID, color = Consumer.ID)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + theme(legend.position = &#39;none&#39;) + facet_wrap(~Age) Mixed models are used when there is repetitions in the response due to (here) the person tasting more than one product. library(lmerTest) library(lme4) mdl &lt;- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID)) summary(mdl) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite&#39;s method [ ## lmerModLmerTest] ## Formula: Liking ~ Beer + (1 | Consumer.ID) ## Data: beerliking ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 3602.4 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.52447 -0.73529 0.08622 0.74232 2.01132 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## Consumer.ID (Intercept) 0.3242 0.5694 ## Residual 2.6615 1.6314 ## Number of obs: 920, groups: Consumer.ID, 155 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.

These three at the bottom is also not significantly different. 9.3 Multivariable models In the example above, only the impact of the different beers is evaluated, however, the liking scores may also depend on background information such as gender, age, … as well as attitude towards beer and food. Further, is there any of the background variables that attenuate or make the differences between the beers stronger? These questions can be investigated by models including several explanatory variables as well as interaction terms. 9.3.1 Additive models This can be included in the models as a sequence of explanatory variables. Given a set of possible explanatory variables, there is two ways to include them in the model. Forward step-wise Selection and Backward Step-wise Elimination. For both, the principle is simple and intuitive. In the forward procedure each variable is added to the model, and the strongest one (in terms of the lowest p-value) is kept. In the backward procedure all variables are added to the model and the least important one (in terms of the largest p-value) is removed. Both procedures stop when the model is not going to improve by adding or eliminating explanatory variables, and the final model will only contain the significant variables. In the beer dataset we would like to know which of the explanatory variables that is most related to the liking.

Similarly, Fruity is related to higher liking in Wheat IPA and Porse Bock but a bad thing in River Beer. Nutty only matters on liking in Ravnsborg Red and River beer. 10.2 PCA on CATA and Liking A PCA on the agglomerated CATA counts including the liking will reveal the attributes associated with the individual products, and which attributes are correlated with the liking. xbeeragglom &lt;- xbeer %&gt;% gather(cata, val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous, Liking) %&gt;% #looong format for all variables group_by(Beer,cata) %&gt;% # summarize for each beer type dplyr::summarise(yy = mean(val, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% spread(cata,yy) # wide format mdlPCAcataliking &lt;- prcomp(xbeeragglom[,-1], scale. = T) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCAcataliking, labels = xbeeragglom$Beer) The attributes Bean, Caramel, Warming, Aromatic etc is associated to the beer Brown ale, while Berrie, Dessert, Pungent, etc. is characteristic of Wheat IPA. Further, Liking is associated with all attributes on the first component, such as Aromatic, Warming, etc. 10.2.1 A beer centric model The above PCA shows general good- and bad attributes in terms of liking. However, the univariate analysis indicated that for some beers e.g. Smoked was a good thing while for others not so much. For that reason we can build a PCA for each beer to see which attributes that drives liking xbeer &lt;- xbeer[complete.cases(xbeer),] PCAmdl_RR &lt;- prcomp(xbeer[xbeer$Beer==&#39;Ravnsborg Red&#39;,14:41], scale. = T) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(PCAmdl_RR) Caramel, Savoury spices and Reefreshing is promoting liking, while Sour is not.

Exercises are meant as a guide on what you can do with your own data obtained through the practical work on the projects. Before you start to work on the exercises, you need to familiarize yourself with the knowledge in the introduction chapters of this book as well as the chapters written specifically of for this course. 12.1 Exercise 1: Descriptive statistics and plots From this exercise you should be able to describe the products in terms of common, rare and differential attributes, as well as the hedonic ratings. 12.1.1 CATA counts Create data set with CATA counts per product and make a table thereof Plot the CATA counts such that product differences are emphasized library(data4consumerscience) data(&quot;beercata&quot;) 12.1.2 Hedonics Plot hedonic ratings (beerliking$Liking) per product in histograms to see the distribution Calculate descriptive statistics for hedonic rating for each product data(&quot;beerliking&quot;) 12.2 Exercise 2: Consumer background and PCA From this exercise you should be able to describe who your consumers are. 12.2.1 Demographics Age, Gender, Income and Household size is classical demographic characteristics. As the evaluation of the products is done using a specific group of people, the generalizability of the results naturally condition of the characteristics of this population. Construct the distributions of the demographic characteristics. You can use the table() function, or maybe do it all at once using the tableone package. For inspiration, modify the code below to serve your needs. library(data4consumerscience) library(tableone) data(&quot;beerdemo&quot;) CreateTableOne(vars = c(&#39;Age&#39;,&#39;Gender&#39;),data = beerdemo) 12.2.2 PCA on Interests Calculate a PCA model including the Variables 7 ( Interest in food ) to 12 ( Future interest in beer ). Remember to standardize/scale the variables mdlPCA &lt;- prcomp(beerdemo[,7:12],scale. = T) Plot the scores and loadings in a biplot and look for groupings of the consumers in the scores. Group and color according to the background information not used in the model (Gender, Age,..) library(ggbiplot) ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = beerdemo$Gender, ellipse = T) Describe what you find. 12.3 Exercise 3: PCA on CATA counts From this exercise you should be able to describe your samples (beers) from the CATA counts, and which attributes that occur together, as well as which attribute patterns that discriminate products. Calculate a PCA model including all Variables and all Objects. PCAmdl &lt;- prcomp(beercata[,3:29], scale. = T) Plot the scores and describe the groupings of the samples. Plot the loadings and describe the correlations between the variables. Both of these plots are present in a biplot, but you may want to play around with the settings (such as varname.size, varname.adjust, …) to get all information out. ggbiplot(PCAmdl, groups = beercata$Beer, ellipse = T) Use this biplot to find out which samples are described by which CATA attributes. as well as similarity of products. 12.4 Exercise 4: Cochran’s Q test on CATA binary data In Exercise 1 the attributes characteristic for certain products, were summarized using descriptive stats and plots. Now we want to add statistical inference onto these observations. To get started, choose a few attributes. For each attribute 1) Perform Cochran’s Q test for overall difference, and if interesting enough 2) perform a Post hoc test for product segmentation. To get all attributes analyzed collectively, use the tidyverse code in the chapter For all attributes in one run (nice to know). Try this procedure out on a different dataset, e.g. the tempeto data. data(&quot;tempetofermentation&quot;) library(RVAideMemoire) tempetofermentation$Product2 &lt;- factor(tempetofermentation$Product) # needs to be a factor for getting labels on results. m &lt;- cochran.qtest(Sour ~ Product2 | Assessor, data = tempetofermentation) 12.5 Exercise 5: Hedonic ratings and consumer characteristics From this exercise you should be able to describe the liking of the beer samples and glimpse into consumer characteristics related to liking 12.5.1 PCA on joint data Calculate a PCA model including all Variables and all Objects. include_these &lt;- complete.cases(beerliking) PCAliking &lt;- prcomp(beerliking[include_these,-1], scale. = T) Plot a biplot or loading plot, and use the loadings and describe the correlations between the variables (liking of beers in this case). ggbiplot(PCAliking) Plot the scores and describe the groupings of the samples by colouring the score plot according to the consumer background variables. Note that the 160 rows in both datasets match each-other, so we can glue the demo information directly onto the liking model. If that was not the case, matching using left_join() or inner_join() would be necessary before analysis. ggbiplot(PCAliking,groups = beerdemo$Age[include_these], ellipse = T) Any trends? For instance, how is liking related to the individual consumer diversity of beer ( Beer types/month)? 12.5.2 All demographics … Some code to get all 7-scale demo information plots. You may want to export and view in a pdf viewer for zooming etc. gall &lt;- cbind(PCAliking$x[,1:2], beerdemo[include_these,]) %&gt;% gather(var,val,`Interest in food`:App_Vinous) %&gt;% ggplot(data = ., aes(PC1,PC2, color = factor(val))) + geom_point() + stat_ellipse() + facet_wrap(~var) ggsave(filename = &#39;anicebigfigure.pdf&#39;,gall, height = 20, width = 20) 12.6 Exercise 6: PCA on CATA counts and hedonic ratings From this exercise you should be able to conclude what attributes that overall drives the liking of products (beers). For each beer, the collated CATA counts and the averaged liking constitutes the multivariate response matrix. likingsum &lt;- beerliking %&gt;% group_by(Beer) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(lik = mean(Liking, na.rm = T)) catasum &lt;- beercata %&gt;% gather(attrib,val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous ) %&gt;% group_by(Beer,attrib) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(mn = mean(val, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% spread(attrib,mn) Join the two. cata_lik &lt;- catasum %&gt;% left_join(likingsum, by = &#39;Beer&#39;) Do a PCA PCAcata_lik &lt;- prcomp(cata_lik[,-1],scale. = T) ggbiplot(PCAcata_lik, labels = cata_lik$Beer) 12.7 Exercise 7: Mixed modelling on hedonic ratings In this exercise we want to model Liking as a response. We want to use the beer type as the main predictor, but take into account that the responses is repeated within consumers. The same judges have evaluated all beers. This is a mixed model Start with a plot ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Beer, Liking)) + geom_boxplot() library(lme4) library(lmerTest) lik_mdl &lt;- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID)) Evaluate this model by anova() and summary(), and interpret the result. How much within individual consumer variation is there compared to between consumer? You should get that the beers are not equally likable. But are there maybe some which are more similar? Perform a all-pairs post hoc test and try to group beers based on liking. library(multcomp) summary(glht(lik_mdl, linfct = mcp(Beer = &quot;Tukey&quot;)), test = adjusted(&quot;fdr&quot;)) Try to add consumer demographics and interest to the model to evaluate general consumer patterns as well as interactions with beer type. Try to answer questions such as: Are there any significant product differences for the liking? If so, what does the post hoc test tell us? How does this fit with what you have done in the PCA exercises. Is the liking in general affected by the age, gender, household size or beer knowledge? What is the effect? Try to think of a plot that can show the significant differences. Do men and women score the samples significantly different in liking? Calculate the sample/gender differences in averages. "],["preference-mapping.html", "Chapter 13 Preference Mapping 13.1 Example of Preference Mapping 13.2 PCA 13.3 Analysis by PLS 13.4 L-PLS [For the future…]", " Chapter 13 Preference Mapping [some narrative] 13.1 Example of Preference Mapping [Which???] 13.2 PCA PCA is a nice tool to get overview of structure in data. Here we explicitly are interested in hedonic liking of the 6 beer types, and whether there are certain beer-drinker profiles, such as some prefer dark beer, while others like wheat or pilsner. The liking data is in long format, and as we want to see correlation between different beers we need to wrap the liking into wide format, this can be done using spread from tidyverse. Further, there is incomplete liking data, and here we only sustain hedonic answers from consumers with all 6 liking answers. This filter can be computed in different ways, here drop_na() is used. library(data4consumerscience) library(tidyverse) data(&quot;beerliking&quot;) xbeerliking &lt;- beerliking %&gt;% spread(Beer,Liking) %&gt;% # make into wide format drop_na() PCA is computed on the liking columns of this matrix mdlPCA &lt;- prcomp(xbeerliking[,13:18]) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA) Those who like Ravnsborg red also likes NY Lager and to some extend Brown ale, while Porse Bock and Wheat IPA also attracts the same consumers. In general there is a trend towards all liking score being positively correlated, meaning, that costumers overall like (or dis like) beer. This can both be a real phenomena, but also an artifact of the consumers not using the scale in a similar fashion. It is a very common phenomena for sensory and hedonic data. We can glue on demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, etc., as well as questions on interest in food and beer on this figure to understand the consumer population. ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = xbeerliking$Gender, ellipse = T) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = factor(xbeerliking$`Beer knowledge`), ellipse = T) In general, the classical demographics do not relate to liking patterns, as shown by gender above. Try the others to confirm. For interest in food and beer there are patterns. One example is the Beer knowledge with higher liking scores for more beer knowledge. Similar intuitive patterns can be seen for some of the other characteristics. 13.3 Analysis by PLS Predictors can be objective characteristics of the products or CATA type data, while response is hedonik liking data.
