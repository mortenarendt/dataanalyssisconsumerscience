## PCA

PCA is nice....

[on beerliking]

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)

mdlPCA <- prcomp(beerliking[complete.cases(beerliking),-1])
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA)
```

Those who like Ravnsborg red also likes NY Lager and to some extend Brown ale.... [some more narrative]

## Analysis by PLS

Predictors can be objective characteristics of the products or CATA type data, while response is hedonik liking data. 
[minimum 5 samples

X = CATA (Beer_XYZmatrix.xlsx, sheet = X CATA (coll.)+Y liking (aver.)), 
Y = Living average
Y2 = Liking for each consumer = t(Y (long thin))

Objective = Visualize to get patterns related to liking, and which deescriptors are merely irrelevant. 

## L-PLS [For the future...]
