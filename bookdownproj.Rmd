# Introduction to the book

This material is to cover data analysis using R for consumer science targeting the following courses: 

* Meal Systems and Technologies
* Food and Meal Consumer Research 
* Thematic Course in Food Innovation and Health

But others may benefit from the material as well....

The initial chapters of the book introduce R and the background for the different statistical methods used in the book. The following parts of the book is divided according to the course hence the data types encountered in the above mentioned courses, 

The format of the book is simple - first read the written text and when you reach a code, copy the code and try it out yourself. 

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

# Introduction to R

R is a free software with a complete programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is used at many universities and companies since it is always updated and open source.

Before staring your calculations in R you should always update the R version on your computer. You can install a graphical interface for R, called R studio. It will use the underlying version of R on your computer -- so you have to have R installed too. The principles by R and R Studio are the same -- BUT R Studio has a better interface for non-programmers. Both R and R Studio can be used on all types of computers.

R is command-line based and it provides a wide variety of statistical methods (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, classification, clustering, ...). Advanced methods are available via extension packages (more than 10.000 at the moment)

Always be sure to have the latest version of both R and R Studio on your computer - update version just before you need to use the program.


## How to get started - understanding R (and RStudio)

A quick intro-tour of R Studio is given here:

And a short intro from our courses: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

### Organise and save scripts

A script is a rundown from A-Z (start to end) of data analysis. A script should be self-contained. I.e. the first lines sets the libraries and imports the data, there after you may want to wrangle the data a bit (changing features as.numeric, as.factor,..., renaming columns, etc.). Thereafter the analysis starts.

Think of a script like making a meal: You need raw-materials (carrots, onions,...) - That is the data You need a kitchen - That is R as the software. You need knifes, pots and pans - That is the packages.

All is needed to work and hence you need to specify them in the script.

In larger projects where the same dataset may be used for several different analysis, it may be wise to have several scripts. One for importing data and modifying it (starts with import and ends with save() as an .RData file). One for descriptive analysis, one for inference, one for plots etc. So you can create a sequence of scripts to keep overview. However, this is only needed for larger projects. In small analysis you can easily include all in one script. ) Remember to put a little narrative (after a "\#" at the top off you script explaining the purpose.

To get started go to upper left corner and open a new script. **Remember to save your script as well**. After you've created a new script, try out our codes:

```{r}
1+2
a <- 2+2
b <- 5+3
```

What happens if you write the letter a in the editor and run it? What about the letter b?

```{r}
a
b
a+b
```

... or this one?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
A+B
```

R is essentially (also a) calculator, but it is case sensitive.

In the Editor:

"\#" is the start of a comment (means: will not evaluated/ read by the program). This is how you can make comments in your script:

```{r}
# I want to add 2 and 5
2+5
# whoop it is 7!
```

":"Generates a sequence (e.g. 1:10 is the numbers from 1 to 10)

```{r}
from1to10 <- 1:10
from10to1 <- 10:1
from1to10
from10to1
```

In the Console:

"\>" indicates that R is ready for a new code.

"+" Instead of "\>" means that the program is waiting for you. (you probably made a mistake in the script you tried to run) -- by [ESC] the "+" turns to a "\>" again

"NA" (Not Available) is indicating a missing value

"NaN" (Not a Number) is the result of an 'illegal' operation e.g. log(-1) Red sentences means there is an error. R will stop calculating at the first error it meets.


## How to import data

### Import data from R-package

In this book several datasets are used targeting different research questions. However, a fair part of the analysis tools are common. That is, descriptive analysis, plots, response correlations etc.

The data is included in the R-packgage *data4consumerscience* you get by running the code below. Be aware that you need devtools package to install packages from github, so you need to run both code lines.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install data-package
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('mortenarendt/data4consumerscience')
```

The data is also available as excel sheets, and can be loaded using packages capable of reading from Excel.

Before you start you data import, you have to make sure the data set contains all the information you need and the format of the data (columns and rows) is correct. You can import in many different ways. 

### Importing a csv file

If the data is not already an csv file, but an excel file, you need to convert it: Open your Excel file, as it is in xls or xlsx format. Convert this file to csv format. NB: Some data collection tools will provide you with your data in csv and some xlsx/xls format. In Excel, you choose the "save as" and then choose \*.csv.

Then move in to R, and write:

```{r, eval = F}
DATASET1 <- read.csv2(file.choose())
```

The file.choose() function makes you point towards the file you want. You can also simply write the path to the file directly.

Actually, by using the file.choose() the first time you import data will prombt the path, and you can simply copy paste this from the console to your script avoiding point and click every time you want to analyse these data.

```{r, eval = F}
DATASET1 <- read.csv2('~/path/to/the/data/myfile.csv')
```

You decide the names/titles of your datasets and models, just do not use other signs than "." and avoid non-English letters. We called it "DATASET1". R will open a new window (sometimes hidden behind your other open windows), open the window to choose the wanted csv file. The data set will now also appear in the upper right corner as a line. If you double click a data set in this box, it will open in the editor window

You can import any \*.csv format dataset, when you try it out.

Trouble shooting: \* Try new csv format in Excel when saving the file in csv format \* Try to write read.csv(file.choose()) instead \* Try another import function (see below)

### Importing an Excel file/sheet

If you have data as excel, you may utilize packages for directly importing, without the need to convert to csv.

If your Excel file contains more than one sheet, you have to import each sheet separately.

Here we use the package **readxl** with the function read_excel. If the data is not in the same folder as your script, then include the path to the data, or move the data to the script's location. The example below imports from an excel file ( _DatasetRbook.xlsx_) a sheet (named e.g. _BuffetData_ ), positioned in a folder (named _data_ ) in the current position. 
You can download this dataset from [here](https://github.com/mortenarendt/dataanalyssisconsumerscience/blob/master/data/iBuffet.xlsx).

When you have to find the path for the file on your computer, you place your cursor within the '' in the command and click the tabulator button. Your computer files will appear, and you can find the path for your file easily. If you cannot find the path, try to use the file.choose() command to find the file, and then copy paste the path from the Console (where you find your output).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
BuffetConsumption <- read_excel('./DatasetRbook.xlsx', sheet = 'PastaBuffet')
BuffetSurvey <- read_excel('./DatasetRbook.xlsx',sheet = 'PastaSurvey')
```

The first part of the model sentence is what we want to call our dataset, here we chose "BuffetConsumption" in the first line (that is the same as the sheet in the Excel file for simplicity). You decide the names/titles of your datasets and model, just do not use other signs than "." and avoid non-English letters.

Try to import sheets from an excel file.

BuffetConsumption is consumption data in grams from a buffet. The data is from 16 different persons, who came on Day 1 and Day 2 to eat Pasta with legumes and/or Pasta with mushroom. In the dataset, there is one line per buffet station per participant per experimental day.

BuffetSurvey is survey data collected in SurveyXact. The dataset contains data on liking, motivation, choices etc. linked to the particular buffet data. Survey could also contain demographics for the participants such as age, gender, eating habits etc. These are general and different from the former, in that they have nothing to do with the current buffet. This type of data is not included in the SurveyData.

### Clipboard import

Last resort is to import via your clipboard. Go to Excel and mark the data you want to import. Make sure there are headings in the data you have marked. Copy the marked data to the clipboard. Go to the Editor and write the following command line:

```{r, eval = F}
DATASET2 <- read.table(file="clipboard", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```

Meaning read the table you saved in your clipboard and save it as the name "DATASET2" (remember you choose this name). The data has headers and should be separated in cells.

Regardless of importation method -- the dataset will appear in the upper right corner environment as a line, please check it looks correct.

You can import from any Excel dataset, when you try it out.

### Looking at the imported elements

Have a look at the imported elements to ensure that indeed, they mimic the Excel sheets. Use the functions head(), str() and View() is your tools. They will give you the headlines in your data, how your variables are categorized and open the dataset in a new tab.

```{r, eval = F}
head(BuffetConsumption)
str(BuffetConsumption)
View(BuffetConsumption)
```

Try to use the BuffetConsumption dataset. If it does not look as expected, try to import it again using a different method.

### Numbers and factors - changing categorisation

During the import R will automatically categorise your variables: if they are read as numbers or letters. For instance, if day of the experiment is called 1 and 2 in the data file and is then read as numeric (num). As Day 2 is not double the value of Day 1, we need to change this variable into a factor (Factor) or character (chr). Use the str() function to check your variables before your change them. You transform your variables using as.numeric() or as.character().

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BuffetConsumption$Day<-as.factor(BuffetConsumption$Day) 
```

Meaning take the variable Day in the dataset you called BuffetConsumption, make it a factor and put it into the same variable name (overwrites it). If you want to have a new variable coded and then keep the old one, simply just give it a new name, e.g. "DayFactor". The dataset will then be extended with one variable, but sometimes it is nice to have both versions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BuffetConsumption$DayFactor<-as.factor(BuffetConsumption$Day) 
```

## How to edit and merge datasets

Sometimes you have to merge two data sets. This is needed if you have for instance consumption data in one Excel sheet and survey data in another Excel sheet.

Setup the data in Excel such that they match the below in terms of format.

What is important is:

-   First row is used on headings and none of these are repeated. I.e. all unique within a sheet
-   Data comes from row 2 and then on to the right
-   All rows should contain data (NB: empty cell is also data, e.g. an unanswered questions), so all empty rows are removed (not cells)
-   Headings between sheets referring to the same: e.g. participant ID should have exactly similar heading
-   If you have calculated stuff within Excel such as a sum of the numbers in a column, then these should be removed from the sheet. It is not data!

We suggest that you keep both the original version of the data as a sheet, and the ready-to-import version as a sheet, so you do not accidentally delete data.

### Edit using Tidyverse

The _Consumption_ data is optimal as is. We have the data as long format with all repsonses in *one* coloumn and then the next columns clarifying the design, time, type, person etc. However the _Survey_ data is not optimal directly. We need to revert the data to both long and wide format.

There are several ways to do this, including editing in Excel. Here we show how it can be done in R using _tidyverse_. Tidyverse is a larger framework. For introduction see:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_youtube("HPJn1CMvtmI")
```

and maybe visit [tidyverse-homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for resources.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

Surveylong <- BuffetSurvey %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing_to_me:`I_like_the_taste_of_pasta_with_mushrooms!`, names_to = 'question',values_to = 'answ')


Surveywide <- Surveylong %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from =  question, values_from = answ)

```

The code above does exactly that, with *Surveylong* and *Surveywide* as the resulting data sets. Try to compare BuffetSurvey with Surveywide - did we already have a wide version of the dataset?

What is also introduced here is the _pipe_ operator **%\>%**. It originates from the *dplyr*-package inside the *tidyverse*-package, and is a handy tool for data manipulation. The way it works is, that whatever is written on the **right** side of the operator, will be used as the first argument in the function written on the **left** side of the operator. This means, that `x %\>% f(y)` will result in f(x,y) - or in our case:

`BuffetSurvey %\>% pivot_longer(cols = Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing_to_me:I_like_the_taste_of_pasta_with_mushrooms!, names_to = 'question',values_to = 'answ')` will be equal to: `pivot_longer(BuffetSurvey, cols = Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing_to_me:I_like_the_taste_of_pasta_with_mushrooms!, names_to = 'question',values_to = 'answ')`

The idea is then to "chain" (or "pipe" as it is also known) `%\>%` together line after line, using different functions in a sequence, which makes the code more readable and often shorter as well.

**pivot_longer** will lengthen the data, by stacking the columns we specified on top of each other, resulting in each row being one single answer to one of the 4 questions. The answer will be in the *answ*-column, the question in the *question*-column, and the rest of the columns can then be used to e.g. group the data.

**pivot_wider** will do the opposite as **pivot_longer**, and spread one column in several columns depending on what the columns contains. In our case the *question*-column in spread into 4 columns, one for each question from the survey, with the numerical values of the answers as their values.

You might have also noticed, that when a variable name contains a space, R needs help understanding that this is indeed a variable. Different symbols are added, and while you CAN write everything just the way R know how to read it, there is an easier way to make sure that everything is written correctly. You can call the variables from the data frame that they originate from, using **"dataframe\$"** and then hit TAB. A list of the variables of which the data frame consist will appear, and from this you can choose the right one - always spelled correctly, and the way R knows how the interpret it.

#### Merging datasets

For the sake of being able to compare consumption (obtained from buffet data) with liking and motives (obtained from the survey data) these data frames needs to be merged. There are several merge options, here we use **left_join()** but **full_join()** and **right_join()** might more suited in some situations - depending on which data set you want to have appear first, and how you want to merge them.

If you feel more comfortable with Excel, you can also merge the two data frames in one Excel sheet before importing it to R.

#### Adding survey to buffets

Merging should be done such that Person and Day in each separate sheet match. If you additionally have demographic data (gender, age, etc.) then obviously only Person should match, as the data is constant over Days.

```{r, eval = F}
Buffet_plus_survey <- BuffetConsumption %>% 
  left_join(BuffetSurvey, by = c('Person','Day'))
```

**left_join** checks in *BuffetSurvey* and *BuffetConsumption* in columns "Person" and "Day", and will add rows from *BuffetSurvey* to *BuffetConsumption* when values in both columns are the same.


## How to save the data

Use **save.image()** to save everything in the *Environment* (all variables shown in the "Environment"-tab in the upper right corner of RStudio), or use **save()** to specify which elements to save using the "list"-input.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Saving everything to the folder of your choice
save.image(file = './data/FolderYouWantToSaveYourProjectTo/AllMyData.RData') 

# Saving just the specified datasets and other elements to your folder of choice
save(file = './data/FolderYouWantToSaveYourProjectTo/SomeOfMyData.RData', list = c('Survey','Surveylong_buffet','Surveylong','Buffet_survey'')) 
```

## How to export data / results to Excel and the like

You can export any data frame from R to excel (for instance using the *rio* package), as well as saving it as .RData for further analysis.

This can obviously be used for exporting your data after some modifications. BUT it is also very useful for exporting data frames with *results* from analysis.

When exporting data, it is also important to tell R where to place the exported file. You do this by specifying the path to the desired folder, followed by the name that **you** choose for the exported file (often it makes sense to choose the same name as the data frame in R).

It is also important to specify the file-extension, to ensure that you create the right file type - in this case *.xlsx*, but rio can also export to other formats such as .txt or .csv.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# export one data frame
rio::export(Surveylong_buffet,file = './data/YourFolderForNiceTables/Surveylong_buffet.xlsx') 
```

## How to load your RData

Once you have saved the data, you can simply load the data directly, and you do not need to do the import-setup every time you want to do an analysis on the data.

This part is not a part of the data import, but it is a good idea just to check that the data indeed is setup as expected.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load('./data/FolderWhereYourDataAreStored/YourData.RData') 
```

## How to clear your environment

When you want to start a new project or a new analysis, it can be useful to clear the environment for the data that you previously used. This can be done either by the code shown below, or by clicking the brush in the top-right part of the RStudio-window.

But be aware - when you clear your environment, you will have to load the data again

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

## How to R project

R Projects offer a structured and organized way to manage your R-based projects, making it easier to keep your work tidy, reproducible, and collaborative.

Some of the benefits om R Projects are:

**Isolation and Dependency Management:** Each R Project has its own working directory and R environment.

**Data Management:** Each project has its own workspace, isolating variables and objects from other projects.

 **Project structuring:** R Projects promotes a structured approach to organizing files

### How to Create an R Project

1. Click on "File" in the top menu.
2. Select "New Project..."
3. Select the project type "New Directory".
4. Select the project type "New project"
5. Specify the project path and project name.
6. Click "Create Project."
7. To switch projects or close projects, select the drop down menu in the upper right corner and select "Your Project Name" or "Close project"

# Libraries

R comes with a bit of functionality. However, most of the useful tools in R is distributed as packages. There are +10.000 package for R, so it is a jungle to figure out what the most easy solution to your problem at hand is. However, the teams who have made tidyverse and ggplot2 etc. have made a lot of things much more easy, and we strongly rely on their tools and routines in data analysis. 

To install packages from CRAN (the main repo where R-packages are distributed)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('SomePackageName')
```

To install packages from github (the online place where all the development and general code sharing is distributed)

```{r,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('DeveloperName/SomePackageName')
```

To make packages available within your analysis use **library()**, or use the package name followed by **::** and the function. The library function will activate the installed package. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot2::qplot(rnorm(100)) # example of a function call without library'ing the package.
```

Tidyverse is a large framework build to handle and manipulate data in a variety of different ways. An example of said manipulation is shown in chapter 1 under [Edit using Tidyverse].

You can find even more information here [tidyverse-homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

# Plotting data

Visualizing data is of utmost importance. 
Especially, looking at the raw data will enable you to point towards outliers and tendencies which may be lost when representing the data with descriptive statistics. 

*ggplot2* is a wide spread library for plotting data and used by a lot of users. Check it out on videos:

```{r, echo=F}
vembedr::embed_youtube("HPJn1CMvtmI")
```


There is a very condensed cheat-sheet for ggplot2 on [RStudios webpage](https://www.rstudio.com/embed/resources/cheatsheets/)

Loading the needed datasets _chili_ and _pasta_: 

`library(data4consumerscience)` load the package *data4consumerscience*, which contains the data *chili* and *pasta*, which are loaded using the **data()**-function.

`pasta <- pasta[pasta$StationName=='Pasta with legumes',]` subsets the dataset *pasta* to only contain the rows, where the value in the column `StationName` is equal to `'Pasta with legumes'`.

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(chili)
data(pasta)
# we subset to only have the "Pasta with legumes" data. 
pasta <- pasta[pasta$StationName=='Pasta with legumes',]
```

## Histograms and boxplots

To show the total consumption a histogram is useful.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = AdLibg)) + geom_histogram()
```

`ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = AdLibg)) + geom_histogram()` creates of a **ggplot()** object using the data from the `chili` dataset. 
It also specifies the aesthetics (visual mappings) for the plot, where `AdLibg` is mapped to the x-axis.

`geom_histogram()` adds a layer to the plot a histogram representing the data. Since no aesthetic mappings are provided inside `geom_histogram()` in this specific line, it's assumed that the `AdLibg` values on the x-axis, with `count` on the y-axis.


The plot reveals a bi-modal distribution with an upper tail. 

These observations comes from 5 different treatments, 27 different judges and at 10 test days. We can infer this using a boxplot with jittered raw data on top. 

Per treatment: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Treatment, y = AdLibg)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter()
```

Again, the **ggplot()**-function is used, specifying the data frame `chili` as the data source for the plot. The `aes()` function is used to define aesthetic mappings. `x = Treatment` maps the variable `Treatment` to the x-axis, and `y = AdLibg` maps the variable `AdLibg` to the y-axis.

`geom_boxplot()` adds a box plot layer to the plot, showing the median, quartiles, and possible outliers in the data. Each box plot will be created for each unique value in the `Treatment` variable on the x-axis.

`geom_jitter()` adds a jitter plot layer to the plot. A jitter plot is used to show individual data points along the x-axis with a small amount of random horizontal jitter to avoid overlapping points. This is especially useful when you have multiple data points with the same x-value. The `AdLibg` values for each `Treatment` will be represented as jittered points along the x-axis.


Per Judge: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = factor(Judge), y = AdLibg)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter()
```

The only thing changed here is what is displayed on the x-axis, which is now `factor(Judge)`. **factor()** is used to specify, that while the values in the column `Judge` are numerical, and thus can be considered continuous, R should treat them as categorical.

None of these explains the bi-modality seen in the histogram. However, we can combine test-day information, which essentially is reflecting whether it is first or second trial splitting at day 5 (`color = factor(TestDay>5)`).
Note that we also added `group = factor(Judge)`, to ensure that the boxplots are grouped according to Judge, rather than according to `factor(TestDay>5)`, as `color` also groups, but is overwritten by `group`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = factor(Judge), y = AdLibg, group = factor(Judge), color = factor(TestDay>5))) +
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter()
```

This coloring shows a clear difference between trials, which explains the bi-modal distribution. It also explains why the two modes of the distribution are overlapping, and why the distribution is skewed. Because while most judges have consumed more during the first trial, some judges did the opposite - higher consumption during the second trial.

## Scatter plots

Lets plot the consumption (AdLibg) as a function of LikingAppearance, and add a tendency line: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = LikingAppearance, y = AdLibg)) + 
  geom_point() + stat_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', se = F)
```

This plot shows `AdLibg` on the y-axis plotted against `LikingApperance` on the x-axis, with `stat_smooth()` adding a tendency line. `formula = 'y ~ x'` specifies, that the tendency line should be fitted to reflect y as a function of x. `se = F` indicates that the standard error around the regression line should not be displayed. Try adding `method = lm` inside the brackets of `stat_smooth`(), and see how the line changes.


Now, lets funk this up by splitting into test-days and get colors according to product: 

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg, color = Treatment)) + 
  geom_point() + stat_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x', se = F, method = lm) + 
  facet_wrap(~ TestDay>5)
```

The only thing added here is `facet_wrap(~ TestDay>5)`. It adds a faceting layer to the plot, which allows you to create multiple small plots (facets) based on the values of a specific variable. Here, `TestDay > 5` is used as the condition for faceting. It means that the data will be divided into facets based on the `TestDay` column, and each facet will show data points and smoothing lines for cases where the value of `TestDay` is lower and greater than 5, respectively.

The plot shows, that the tendency of food intake increasing with increased hunger, is  true for all treatments, as well as during both trial days.


## How to export plots 

The plots shown in the _Plots_ pane (lower right of RStudio) can be saved using the _Export_ bottom. 

You can also save the plots to a file using the **ggsave()**-function. 

If you run **ggsave()** without specifying which plot to export, it will use the latest. You can also directly specify the plot to export: 

```{r, fig.height=9, eval = F}
myplot <- ggplot(data = chili, aes(Hunger,AdLibg, color = Treatment)) + 
  geom_point() + stat_smooth(se = F, method = lm) + facet_wrap(~ TestDay>5)

ggsave('./data/YourFolderForNicePlots/hunger_vs_consumption.pdf',myplot)
```

The first line of code saves the plot as a **ggplot**-object named `myplot`, and the second line saves the object `myplot` to the path that you specify (`'./data/YourFolderForNicePlots/hunger_vs_consumption.pdf'`),

**ggsave()** supports different formats (.png, .tiff, .pdf,...) and further allows for editing the size (height = , width = ). Just change the *.pdf* in to the format your need.

# Descriptive statistics

In this Chapter we will go through the main elements of descriptive statistics.

In principle, descriptive statistics is the act of taking a bunch of data and represent them in few numbers, such as mean, median, standard deviation etc.

For a more thorough introduction you can check every introductory stats book: The first couple of chapters will cover this.

For examples in this chapter we will use two datasets: *chili*: where and green tea in combination is added to meals and the resulting ad-libitum consumption is recorded, and *pasta* which is iBuffet data with a survey of preferences for each Person.

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(chili)
data(pasta)
# we subset to only have the "Pasta with legumes" data. 
pasta <- pasta[pasta$StationName=='Pasta with legumes',]
```

If you do not have imported the *data4consumerscience* package see: [Import data from R-package] If you need to import data see: [How to import data]

## Descriptives for a continuous variable

Below we will first explain the different descriptive measures, and then describe calculations of them. Continuous variables could be sensory scores (e.g. 15 cm continuous line scale), consumption data (in gram) or liking scores (e.g. on a scale from 1 to 9).

### Mean / median

Here you get an introduction to statistics, descriptive statistics and the terms average/mean and median:

```

```

vembedr::embed_youtube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvDqbzu0i0E&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566&index=5")
```

### Calculations

For the calculations, we use the *chili* dataset. To compute mean, median, variance, standard deviation, etc. there are functions working directly on vectors/columns in you data frame. An easy way to specify this in R is using the **\$**-sign after the name of your data frame, followed by the column name (e.g. `chili$Totalg`). `na.rm = TRUE` removes NA values in the vector. This can be done for all the below functions.

```{r}
mean(chili$Totalg, na.rm = TRUE)
median(chili$Totalg)
var(chili$Totalg)
sd(chili$Totalg)
IQR(chili$Totalg)
summary(chili$Totalg)
```

## Distributions of count data

If the response can take certain values or categories, then the table function is good in getting how many observations there are within a given vector, or combinations of several vectors.

```{r}
table(pasta$I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes)
```

```{r}
table(pasta$I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes, pasta$Did_you_consider_the_proteincontent_of_the_dishes_you_choose)
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#[MANGLER: skal vi overveje at lave dette med CATA data i stedet for? jeg er ikke helt vild med legumes datasÃ¦ttet nemlig.... men kan ogsÃ¥ bare blive stÃ¥ende]
```

You see that most of the answers are in agreement with question, and that there are no observations in the `Strongly disagree` category.

This is a very high level representation, and we usually want to compare means (or other metrics) between different groups. That is to compute descriptive statistics for subsets of the data. There are two ways to do this. Either using the **aggregate()** function or use the **group_by()** and **summarize()** from the *tidyverse* framework.

Below both is shown to characterize `Totalg` on each of the products

## Aggregate

```{r}
aggregate(chili$Totalg,by = list(chili$Treatment),FUN = mean)
aggregate(chili$Totalg,by = list(chili$Treatment),FUN = sd)
```

**aggregate()** will apply a function to a column or data set, using the list provided to group the column or dataset.

In our case, the column we want to apply our function to is `chili$Totalg`, the functions are `FUN = mean` or `FUN = sd` (finding the mean and standard deviation, respectively) and the column we use for grouping the data is `chili$Treatment`.

This results in a data frame, where one column shows each unique group in `chili$Treatment`, and another column shows the mean or standard deviation of `chili$Totalg` corresponding to each group.

## Tidyverse

... or you can do it using *tidyverse*:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tb <- chili %>% 
  group_by(Treatment) %>% # specify which grouping vector to use
  summarise(n = n(), # compute n
            mn = mean(Totalg), # compute mean
            s = sd(Totalg), # compute s
            q1 = quantile(Totalg,0.25), # compute lower 25% quartile
            q3 = quantile(Totalg,0.75)) # compute upper 75% quartile
tb  
```

**group_by** will use the column specified to group the data, and the groups are then used when further manipulation is applied to the data frame.

**summarise** will create a summary of the input data, with the columns specified in the code, calculation the statistics also written in the code (e.g. `mn = mean(Totalg)` will create a column with the mean of `Totalg`, for each group in `Treatment`, as specified by `group_by()`).

For more information about data manipulation with tidyverse, see [Edit using Tidyverse] or check out the [tidyverse-homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

Further, lets print the results in a nice looking table using kable() from the knitr package.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(tb, caption = 'some caption', digits = 0, format = 'simple')
```

```{r, include=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
#[MORTEN: kan vi lave en anden form for tabel her? Meld gerne ind hvad type data det kunne vÃ¦re?? for den man fÃ¥r ud giver ikke sÃ¥ meget mening set fra vores side. og sÃ¥ skal vi overveje om "tidyverse" er nice to know viden?]

```

... and a plot of it:

```{r}
tb %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(Treatment,mn, ymin = q1, ymax = q3)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar()
```

`tb %>%`: This line is using the pipe operator (`%>%`), which is native to the *dplyr*-package and is used in R to chain together multiple operations. It takes the result of the expression on the left and pipes it as the first argument to the function on the right. In this case, `tb` is being piped into the subsequent operations.

`ggplot(data = ., aes(Treatment, mn, ymin = q1, ymax = q3))`: This line initiates the creation of a ggplot object using the data from the `tb` dataset. It specifies the aesthetics (visual mappings) for the plot. `Treatment` is mapped to the x-axis, `mn` is mapped to the y-axis, and `q1` and `q3` are representing the first and third quartile respectively, here graphically represented using errorbars.

`geom_point()`: This line adds a layer to the plot with points (or dots) representing the data points. Since no aesthetic mappings are provided in this specific line, it's assumed that the `Treatment` values are plotted against the `mn` values on the x- and y-axes.

`geom_errorbar()`: This line adds another layer to the plot with error bars. The `ymin` and `ymax` aesthetics defined in the `ggplot()` call earlier are used to show the first and third quartile respectively, creating a visual representation of the distribution of the data.

More information on plotting will come in a future chapter (see [Plotting data]). But try and see if you can make sense of the inputs, and what they correspond to in the plot.

# Inferential statistics

## Intro

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making predictions or estimates about a population based on a sample of data from that population. The goal of inferential statistics is to use the sample data to draw conclusions about the population as a whole.

This approach is quite neat, as it would be rather time-consuming to e.g. measure the height of every person in the whole world (the population), to be able to show the average height of a person. To avoid this, a (more or less) representative sample is used to estimate the average height of a person, while taking into account the uncertainty that arises from not measuring the whole population.

And while the process of obtaining a representative sample is a crucial aspect of inferential statistics, it is outside the scope of this book, and will therefore not be addressed further.

Inferential statistics use a variety of techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), all of which will be introduced in the following sections.

## Hypothesis testing

Statistical hypothesis testing starts with a hypothesis about a population parameter (such as the mean or proportion). Then data are collected, after which statistical techniques are used to decide whether the data provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis or not.

There are two types of hypotheses in hypothesis testing: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference between groups. It is typically denoted as $H_{0}$. The alternative hypothesis is a statement of the opposite of the null hypothesis. It is typically denoted as $H_{A}$ or $H_{1}$.

The process of hypothesis testing typically involves the following steps:

1.  Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses. For example: The average height of men and women is the same. $H_{0}: \mu_{men}=\mu_{women} \\ H_{A}: \mu_{men}\neq\mu_{women}$

2.  Select a significance level ($\alpha$). This is the probability of making a Type I error, which means rejecting the null hypothesis when in fact, it is true (usually, $\alpha = 0.05$ is used, but this can vary depending on the application).

3.  Collect data and compute a test statistic (which test statistic will depend on the desired test - examples will be presented in the following sections).

4.  Determine the p-value. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

5.  Compare the p-value to the significance level. If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

It's important to note that hypothesis testing is not about proving the hypothesis to be true or false. Instead, it's about deciding whether the data provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

A measure to evaluate whether the conclusion of the hypothesis test is valid, is called power, and will be introduced in the following section.

### Power

Statistical power is a measure of the probability that a statistical test will detect a difference between two groups or treatments if one actually exists. It can also be described as the probability to NOT commit a Type II/$\beta$-error.

<!-- IndsÃ¦t billede af to fordelinger, med alpha og beta-fejl markeret -->

<!-- IndsÃ¦t tabel med alpha og beta-fejl der viser falsk positiv og falsk negativ -->

The statistical power of a hypothesis test is influenced by several factors, including the size of the sample, the magnitude of the difference between the groups or treatments being compared, and the level of significance (alpha) that is chosen for the test. A test with high statistical power is more likely to detect a difference between the groups or treatments being compared, while a test with low statistical power is less likely to detect a difference.

In practice, power can be hard to calculate, as one needs to know the characteristics of the distribution describing the alternative hypothesis (e.g. mean, standard deviation, etc.). These characteristics are unknown, but are sometimes estimated using previous trials dealing with similar samples to estimate the power of a trial.

## Confidence intervals

A confidence interval is a range of values that is calculated from a sample of data, and it is used to estimate the true population parameter. It is called a confidence interval because it provides a level of confidence that the true population parameter falls within the range of values calculated from the sample.

The size of the confidence interval depends on the size of the sample, the level of confidence chosen, and the variability of the data. The larger the sample size and the lower the variability, the smaller the confidence interval will be. Confidence intervals are commonly used in statistical analysis to estimate the mean, standard deviation, and other parameters of a population.

Below is shown how to calculate the confidence interval of an estimated mean, assuming the the population follows a T-distribution. $$CI_{\mu}: \hat{\mu} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2,df} \cdot \hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{n}$$ The t-fratcile can be found in a T-table, or using qt(1-$\alpha$/2,df) (which usually means qt(0.975, n-1)). $\hat{\sigma}$ is the estimated standard deviation, and n is the number of samples used to calculate the mean.

The confidence interval can also be used in hypothesis testing. For example, let's say that the average height of men is 180cm, with a 95% confidence interval of $\pm10cm$. The null hypothesis is, that men and women have the same average height ($\mu_{men} = \mu_{women}$), whereas the alternative hypothesis is, that their average height is not the same ($\mu_{men} \neq \mu_{women}$).

If the height of women falls outside this confidence interval (meaning that the mean is larger than 190cm or lower than 170cm), one would be able to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude, that men and women do not have the same average height.

## T-test

A T-test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is commonly used to compare the means of two groups that have been sampled from a larger population, to see if the groups are significantly different from one another.

The hypotheses of a T-test: $$ H_{0}: \mu_{1}=\mu_{2} \\ H_{A}: \mu_{1}\neq\mu_{2}, \ \mu_{1}>\mu_{2}  \ or \ \mu_{1}<\mu_{2}$$
Which alternative hypothesis to choose depends on the question that one wants answered.

There are several types of T-tests, including the independent samples T-test and the paired samples T-test. The independent samples T-test is used to compare the means of two separate groups, while the paired samples T-test is used to compare the means of two related groups, such as before and after measurements.

To conduct a T-test in R, you can use the **t.test()** function. This function takes the following arguments:

-   x and y: These are the two groups that you want to compare. They can be vectors or data frames.

-   alternative: This specifies the alternative hypothesis. You can choose between "two.sided" (the default), "greater", or "less".

-   mu: This specifies the hypothesized mean difference between the two groups. By default, it is set to 0.

-   paired: This should be set to TRUE if you are conducting a paired samples t-test. Default is FALSE.

-   var.equal: Can be TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether or not the variances of the two groups can be treated as equal. Default is FALSE.

-   conf.level: The confidence level of choice. Default is 0.95.

Here is an example using the BuffetSurvey data set:

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(pasta)

t.test(x = pasta$Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing, 
       y = pasta$Pasta_with_mushrooms_is_visually_appealing)
```

This results in a p-value of 0.036, which is below the chosen $\alpha$-level of 0.05. This means, that there is a significant difference between how visually appealing pasta with legumes and pasta with mushrooms perceived.

## F-test

An F-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the variance of two populations or samples. It is often used to test whether two groups have the same variance, or whether the variance of one group is significantly larger or smaller than the variance of another group.

The hypotheses of an F-test: $$ H_{0}: var_{1}=var_{2} \\ H_{A}: var_{1}\neq var_{2}, \ var_{1}>var_{2}  \ or \ var_{1}<var_{2}$$

To conduct an F-test in R, you can use the **var.test()** function. This function takes two numeric vectors as input, and returns the F-value and p-value of the test.

Here is an example using the BuffetSurvey data set:

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(pasta)

var.test(x = pasta$Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing, 
         y = pasta$Pasta_with_mushrooms_is_visually_appealing)
```

The p-value of the F-test is 0.037, which is below the chosen $\alpha$-level of 0.05. This means, that the variance of the scores for how visually appealing pasta with legumes is significantly different from variance of the scores for how visually appealing pasta with mushrooms. - This actually confirms, that the correct T-test was used in the section above, since the T-test with unequal variance was used.

While it is nice to use the F-test on two groups of samples, another very important statistical method uses the F-test to calculate its p-values - the ANOVA or Analysis of Variance, which will be introduced in the following section.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to test the equality of means among more than two groups. But instead of directly comparing the observed means of the groups (which would lead to multiple tests), one can use get away with one test analyzing variance (hence the name).

This is done by comparing the variance BETWEEN groups to the variance WITHIN groups. If the variance between the groups is significantly larger than the variance within the groups, we can conclude, that the mean of at least one of the groups is significantly different from the rest. To test whether the variances differ significantly, an F-test is used to compare the variances. If the p-value is below the selected $\alpha$-level (often $\alpha$=0.05)

As hypotheses, it looks like this (k is the number of groups): 
$$ H_{0}: \mu_{1}=\mu_{2} = ... =\mu_{k}  \\ H_{A}: At \ least \ one \ mean \ is \ different $$
ANOVA can be performed using one-way ANOVA, multiple-way ANOVA, depending on the application, which can be seen below.

### One-way ANOVA
In a one-way ANOVA, we analyze the effect of one categorical factor on a response. This could e.g. be if country of origin has an impact on the alcohol content of the wine produced in that country, or if your dietary preference has an impact on your body weight. 
When conducting a one-way ANOVA, the model looks like this:
$$ Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha(A_{i}) + e_{ij}  \\ where \ e_{ij}  \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}) \ and \ independent \\ for \ j=1,...,n_{i} \ and \ i=1,...,k $$ 
Here, $Y_{ij}$ represents the jth observation of the ith treatment level (i = 1 to k and j = 1 to $n_i$).This means, that e.g., $Y_{23}$ represents the 3rd observation of the 2nd factor. $\mu$ is the grand mean of the dataset, and $\alpha$ is effect of the i-th level of our factor A (e.g. Argentina or France as wine-producing countries, or pescetarian as your dietary preference).

The ANOVA works, when the above-mentioned assumptions are true: The residuals ($e_{ij}$) are normally distributed around 0, and independent. A way to check the assumptions, is to use the built-in **plot()**-function in R, and look at whether the data are normally distributed using the QQ-plot, and looking at the residuals, to check if the assumptions are viable.

To show how to perform a one-way ANOVA in R, here is an example using the *beerliking*-dataset:

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("beerliking")

model <- lm(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer)

plot(model,which = c(1,2))

anova(model)
```

First, the model is created using **lm()**, specifying the dataset used, and the dependent and independent variables (Liking and Beer, respectively)

The resulting table of the **anova()**-function is called an ANOVA-table, and contains a lot of information about the data. But the column that we are most often looking at is `Pr(>F)`, which is another name for the p-value. If this value is below the chosen $\alpha$-level (often $\alpha$=0.05, which in this case it is), then we can conclude, that the judges like at least one of the Beers significantly better/worse than the rest. 

### Two-way ANOVA

As the name suggests, the two-way ANOVA includes two categorical factors in the model instead of one in one-way ANOVA, and compares both factors' (and their interaction) effects on the response. This could be the effect of e.g. both the country of origin as well as the grape variety on the liking of wine.

For a two-way ANOVA with factor A with a levels, and factor B with b levels:
$$ Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha(A_{i}) + \beta(B_{j}) + \gamma(A_{i}\times B_{j}) + e_{ijk}  \\ where \ e_{ijk}  \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}) \ and \ independent \\ for \ i=1,...,a \ and \ j=1,...,b \ and \ k=1,...,n_{ij} $$

Here, $Y_{ijk}$ represents the kth observation of the ith level of factor A, and jth level of factor B.This means, that e.g., $Y_{234}$ represents the 4th observation of the 2nd level of A and the 3rd level of B. $\mu$ is the grand mean of the dataset, $\alpha$ is the effect of the ith level of factor A (e.g. Argentina or France as wine-producing countries), $\beta$ is the effect of the jth level of factor B (e.g. Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Riesling, etc.) and $\gamma$ is the interaction effect between factor A and B (e.g. French Chardonnay or German Riesling).

As with the one-way ANOVA, the same assumptions about normality and independence of the residuals has to hold, and these can again be checked using **plot()** as shown below.

However, the **anova()**-function should be used with caution, when model have more than one independent variable. This is the case, because, **anova()** is performing what is commonly referred to as a Type I ANOVA, also called a sequential ANOVA, where the factors are tested in the specified order. Theoretically, this could be what you want, but in most cases we are interested in the effect of a factor, regardless of order. 

This is called a Type II ANOVA, and in R it can be performed using **drop1**, as shown below in model2. 

However, if an interaction effect is present (e.g. if the effect of Riesling is enhanced by the wine originating from Germany), then a Type II ANOVA only returns the effect of this interaction, due to the [principle of marginality](https://randomeffect.net/post/2020/08/11/principle-of-marginality/). This implies, that if an interaction is in fact present, the "simple" main effects (of e.g. country and grape alone) are poor estimators of the response. If the interaction is non-significant, however, it should be removed from the model, and we end up with a Type II model with the main effects.

If for some reason we are interested in both the main effects and the interaction (if the interaction effect is significant), we can perform what is called a Type III ANOVA. This will test all effects against a model without said effect. As this will over-parameterise the model, in R, one has to choose a contrasts setting that sums to zero, otherwise the ANOVA analysis will give incorrect results. This is what is done with `options`. Then model3 is created to also test the interaction, and in **drop1()** it is specified, that we want all model components to be tested (Type III ANOVA), using `.~.`.

If there is no significant interaction effect, a Type II ANOVA is a stronger test, which is why one should choose it if possible.

More on the different types of ANOVA [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/anovas-three-types-of-estimating-sums-of-squares-don-t-make-the-wrong-choice-91107c77a27a) and [here](https://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/anova-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/).

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(beerliking)

model2 <- lm(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + Age)

plot(model2,which = c(1,2))

drop1(model2, test = 'F')

options(contrasts = c('contr.sum','contr.poly'))
model3 <- lm(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + Age + Beer:Age)

plot(model3,which = c(1,2))

drop1(model3, .~., test = 'F')
```

It looks like we have no significant interaction effect, since the p-value = 0.48 > $\alpha$ (0.05). This means, that we can look at the Type II-analysis. Here, it shows that Beer-type is very important for the Liking score, since the p-value = 6.784e-07, which is way lower than $\alpha$. Age is very close to $\alpha$, which suggests, that even though the effect is technically non-significant, it might be worth looking into whether all ages like beer the same.


### Post hoc test - Tukey's Honest Significant Difference

After the ANOVA, we might have concluded, that at least one of the groups of at least one of the factors is significantly different from the rest. Now you would like to know which one(s) of the groups this significant difference originates from.

This is where the Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (in short, Tukey test) is very useful.

To compare more than two groups, one would have to conduct multiple pairwise T-tests. This does, however, not hold up, as probabilities are cumulative, which means that while the first test would yield a p-value lower than $\alpha$ (often 0.05), when conducting multiple tests, the cumulative p-value could exceed $\alpha$. 

A Tukey test corrects for this, and is therefore a better fit when dealing with more than two groups.

There are several ways to conduct a Tukey test in R, but the one that works in most usecases is the one shown below, using the *multcomp*-package and the **glht()**-function. The dataset used here is the *beerliking*-dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(multcomp)
library(data4consumerscience)
data("beerliking")

beerliking$Beer <- as.factor(beerliking$Beer)

model <- lm(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer)

summary(glht(model, linfct = mcp(Beer = "Tukey")))
cld(glht(model, linfct = mcp(Beer = "Tukey")))
```

When inserting the **glht()**-object into **summary()**, the individual, pairwise comparisons are shown, with the adjusted p-values.

Another (sometimes easier to interpret) way of displaying the pairwise comparison is by the use of letters, as is shown using **cld()**. When groups have different letter, they are significantly different from one another, while groups sharing a letter means no significant difference between the two. Here, we can see, that Brown Ale has scored significantly higher than Wheat IPA, since they have been assigned with c and a respectively. But the Brown Ale is not significantly different from the Ravnsborg Red, as they both have been assigned with a's.

## Introduction to linear and mixed models 

Linear models are one of the most used statistical methods. The definition is that the response is linear in the parameters. This means, that it one can see it as an extention of the ANOVA-models already described, but with the independent variable now being continuos rather than categorical. If $y$ is the response, and $x$ is the predictor, then both of the models below are linear models

$$y = a + b\cdot x + e$$

$$y = a + b\cdot x + c\cdot x^2 + e$$
Here you see that the response is linear in the parameters $a,b,c$. I.e. it has nothing to do with being linear in the predictor. 


## Normal and Mixed models

### Normal model

In a _normal_ linear model such as: 

$$y = a + b\cdot x + e$$

The assumption is that the uncertainty is captured by one entry, namely the residuals ($e$). 
For instance, the relation between `Hunger` and the intake  `AdLibg` of dishes with Capsaicin can be visualized and modeled by the code below.

First, we load the data from the *data4consumerscience*-package as well as the line `data('chili')` , and load the *tidyverse*-package, to be able to manipulate the data as well as plot them.

The code uses the pipe operator `%>%` to chain together a series of data manipulation steps using the *dplyr*-package from the *tidyverse*.

`filter(Treatment=='Capsaicin')` filters the dataset to include only rows where the `Treatment` column has the value `Capsaicin`. 

`filter(!duplicated(Judge))` filters out duplicated rows based on the `Judge` column.

This creates a new **data.frame**, which is assigned to the name `x`.

The next chuck of code creates the plot, using the **ggplot()** function. 

The `data` argument is set to the filtered dataset `x`, and aesthetics (`aes()`) mappings are defined:
   - `x = Hunger`: The x-axis is mapped to the `Hunger` column in the dataset.
   - `y = AdLibg`: The y-axis is mapped to the `AdLibg` column in the dataset.

`geom_point()` adds individual points to the plot, where each point represents a combination of `Hunger` and `AdLibg` values from the dataset.

`stat_smooth(method = lm, se = F)` adds a smoothed regression line to the plot using linear regression (`method = lm`). The `se = F` argument indicates that the standard error around the regression line should not be displayed.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data4consumerscience)
data('chili')
x <- chili %>%   # only include a single treatment
  filter(Treatment=='Capsaicin') %>% # only include the first trial for each judge
  filter(!duplicated(Judge)) 

ggplot(data = x, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = lm, se = F)
```

Naturally, the more hungry, the higher the intake. 

A model describing this relation is shown below.

The first line of code uses the `lm()` function to fit a linear regression model. 

`mdl` is the name given to the linear regression model that will be created.

`data = x` specifies, that `x` is the dataset used for the linear regression.

`AdLibg ~ Hunger` specifies the formula of the model. Here, `AdLibg` is the dependent variable and `Hunger` is the independent variable. The tilde (`~`) separates the dependent and independent variables.

The **summary()**-function is used to display information about the model `mdl`.

```{r}
mdl <- lm(data = x, AdLibg~Hunger)
summary(mdl)
```

Here we see that consumption increases by $3.45g$ per increase in $1$ hunger scale, and that this slope has a standard error of $1.08g$ (`Estimate` and `Std. Error` under `Coefficients`). Further, at Hunger=0 the intake is $379.8g$. Further, we see that this relation is significant $p = 0.0036$ (`Pr(>|t|)` under `Coefficients`). 

More details on the use of linear models in R and how-to can be viewed in these videos: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_youtube("66z_MRwtFJM")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_youtube("2mAqgL0Xc-s")
```


### Mixed model

A _mixed_ model refers to the situation, where more than one part of the model is handling the uncertainty. 
For instance, in the chili data set there are two instances for each judge, and hence the uncertainty can be split into _between_ judges and _within_ judges. 

In this plot the intake is shown across products (_Treatment_) and labelled with the _Judge_ number. For instance, Judge 1 is in general high and 24 generally low. Further, the plot is splitted according to the two test-repetition (First: TestDays = 1,..,5, Second: TestDays = 6,..,10). 


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = chili, aes(x = Hunger, y = AdLibg, color = Treatment)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = Judge)) + 
  stat_smooth(method = lm, se = F) + 
  facet_wrap(~TestDay>5)
```

The above-mentioned structure is encoded in the modelling. **lmer** is used, when creating a mixed effect model. The judges and the test day are considered random effects, and are assigned to be so by adding a 1 and a horizontal line when creating the model.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
chili$TestDay2 <- factor(chili$TestDay>5) # adding a new testday variable
mdlmix <- lmer(data = chili, AdLibg ~ Hunger*Treatment + (1|Judge)  + (1|(TestDay2)))
summary(mdlmix)
```

The summary spits out the model estimates, and especially the random effects shows that the within individual residual variation is $130g$ while the between individual variation is larger: $164g$. I.e. the consumption is more depend on the individual than the repetitions. Further, the testday also has a little effect ($54g$).


We can evaluate the systematic effect overall by **anova**. When **anova** is used on a model created by **lmer**, it conducts a Type III ANOVA.

```{r}
anova(mdlmix)
```

This shows that Hunger indeed will make you eat more, but the slopes and offsets in relation to the different products is non-significant. 


To learn more and see how to conduct the analysis in R, see here: [More on ANOVA and mixed models](https://stat.ethz.ch/~meier/teaching/anova/index.html)

# Introduction to PCA and multivariate data

Multivariate data is defined as a set of (multiple) response variables measured on the same set of samples. In principle these response variables can be of any nature (continuous, ordinal, binary), but mostly PCA is used for analysis of continuous variables. 

In this book Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used several times. This chapter will shortly explain the theory behind PCA and the interpretation of relevant plots.  

PCA is a tool for looking a correlation structure between variables, and groupings of samples. _All through visualizations_.  
Check out YouTube on the subject for an introduction.

A conceptual introduction is given here: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_youtube("NFIkD9-MuTY")
```


## A bit of math

The multivariate dataset is organized in a matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ samples and $p$ variables. 
This matrix is factorized into so called scores ($\mathbf{T}$) and loadings ($\mathbf{P}$).

$$ \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{E} $$

This estimation is done such that the residuals ($\mathbf{E}$) is minimized in a least squares sense. 
The upside of using PCA is that we characterize the sample distribution (what is similar and different) using plots of $\mathbf{T}$, and the correlation of the responses using plots of $\mathbf{P}$. 

In addition to PCA there exists a range of methods for factorizing multivariate datasets including Partial Least Squares (PLS), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Correspondence Analysis (CA), Redundancy Analysis (RA), and a lot more. 
Conceptually, all these methods aims to make a latent-factor model just like PCA, and hence understanding the idea and especially how PCA is used, opens up for using a wide range of variants. 

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#[Question to Aasmund: What should we extend with? - another video?]
```

## Interpreting model output

For calculating a PCA model, we will use the dataset _beef_. It is a sensory descriptive profile on vacuum packed beef steaks heat treated in water baths at different temperatures for different times (sous vide) In total 12 combinations. The samples are coded as e.g. 56-03, meaning the sample has been treated for 56 degrees for 3 hours. There are 10 assessors in the panel, four sensory repetitions and 22 attrributes (A-Brownsurface to T-Salt). 

The first 3 columns of the dataset is used for the design. 
The PCA is computed on the response variables _only_. 

These can be chosen using the hard brackets []. The way to chose only a part of a dataset (to subset) is done by specifying the following inside the []:
A dataset often has two dimensions, rows and columns. In this case, the [] takes two inputs: which row you want, and which columns you want. These are seperated by a comma. This means, that if you write: dataset[1:4,2:6], the result will be rows 1-4, of columns 2-6. If nothing is written on one side of the comma, all of the rows/columns are chosen.


```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(beef)

mdlPCA <- prcomp(beef[,4:25], scale. = T, center = T)
```

### Biplot 

The *ggbiplot* package (and function) is a needed tool to plot the PCA model. 

Installation of this is done by: 

```{r, eval = F, include=T}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('vqv/ggbiplot')
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA)
```

The PCA tries to capture the maximum structure of the data in a few dimensions called principal components (PC1, PC2,...).  

The arrows and labels reflects the correlation structure between the responses. I.e we see that the _Bouillon_ characteristics is correlated and explains PC2, while textural properties like _Rubberband_, _Chewtime_ is correlated, and oppositely correlated of _Tender_, and collectively explains PC1. 

We can decorate the scores with design information, such as beef type as well as judge

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = beef$ProductName, ellipse = T)
```

All though this plot is a bit messy, we see that higher temperature promotes higher position on PC2: I.e. moving from bloody to bouillon. While PC1 to some extend captures trends in cooking time. 

```{r}
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups =  beef$Assessor, ellipse = T)
```

Coloring according to judge reveal that judge A04 is low in range (variance), and hence do not utilize the entire response scale, A03 tends  to rate higher on _rubberband_, _chewtime_, _bloodmetal_, etc. especilly compared to A10, which is higher in _bouillon_ / PC2.
This plot indicates how well trained the panel is, as we optimally have only smaller impact of the individual judges. 

NOTE: If the **ggbiplot()** needs modification, for instance, if the loading labels are exceeding the boundaries, or are too small, then look into the ggbiplot arguments such as `varname.size`. Also normal *ggplot2*-functionallity like `xlim()`, `ylim()` or `theme()` can help to modify the plot.

# Buffet and survey data
## Buffet data
### Introduction to buffet data

In the Meal Systems and Technologies course, we work with data from the iBuffet and data from a survey. You have to merge the two datasets. You can do this in Excel or in R. For the Excel guide, please see the teaching materials of the course in Absalon. For the R guide, please see [How to edit and merge datasets]

This chapter is missing a "Table 1", as the data is insufficient in this part. 

Our data analysis process for buffet and survey data is described below for a very simple dataset. Please elaborate plots and models to fit your own data. 

First, it is a good idea to have a look at the dataset, see what the columns and rows consist of - it could also be a good idea to do some descriptive statistics. All of this is covered in the following chapters: [Looking at the imported elements] and [Descriptive statistics].

Often however, it is much easier to understand the data when they are plotted.

### Plotting buffet data

Below is one way to plot the data of the consumption from the buffet:
```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(ggplot2)

data(pasta)

ggplot(data = pasta, aes(x = factor(Day), y = Consumption)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Person)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = Person, color = Person)) + 
  facet_wrap(~StationName) + 
  xlab('Day')
```

The plot shows a boxplot of the consumption for each day and for each serving station, and each point is the consumption of one person from one station. The colors are added to make it easier to see, how the consumption of the same person changes from day to day, as well as for each of the stations. For more information on plotting, see [Plotting data].

Both the days and the stations look quite similar, but it also looks as if the variation in consumption is dependent on person. To test whether this is the case, we create a mixed model.

### Mixed model for buffet data

The reason we create a mixed model is that we want to isolate the effect of day and station from the variation caused by which person actually consumed the food. This is done in the example below. For more information on mixed models, see [Mixed model].

<!-- buffet comsumption: et enkelt descr. plot samt henvise til relevante kapitler i starten, sÃ¥ da data er for simple? +mixed model med alt, consumerID=random effekt -->

We use the packages **lme4** and **lmerTest**, and use the data called **pasta** from the **data4consumerscience**-pacakge. The function **lmer** will create a mixed model when set up as below. This will yield how Day and StationName affect Consumption. When using '*' between Day and StationName, we tell R that we want both the effect of Day and StationName alone, as well as their interaction effect - which could be e.g. if 10 people tasted the pasta with mushrooms on day 1 and decided that they like this station better, and as a result increase consumption on day 2.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(data4consumerscience)

data(pasta)

mdlmix <- lmer(data = pasta, Consumption ~ factor(Day)*StationName + (1|Person))
summary(mdlmix)
```

What we often look at in an output like this is the p-values (Pr(>|t|)), which indicate whether or not the variable affects the model. The intercept is irrelevant in this case, as it tests whether or not the intercept is 0, and this is not relevant. What we observe is, that none of the p-values are below 0.05, which is the usual significance level used. This means, that neither day nor station has a significant impact on consumption, even when correcting for the variation caused by different people eating at the buffet.

## Survey data

Survey data are (as the name implies) the result of a survey, where the questions can vary dramatically. The dataset used here does not have a lot of questions, so please feel free to elaborate on plots and models when analyzing your own data.

The same general advice applies here as in the case of the buffet data - inspect your data, calculate some descriptive statistics, and plot the data, to get a better understanding of the data.

### Plotting survey data

Below are some examples of plots. First, a barplot showing the whether or not the participants of the survey considered the protein content of the dishes, split between day 1 and 2. 
Secondly, a histogram of the liking scores for each station, shown as the number of people giving a certain score on the Likert-scale.

The histogram can be created by creating each plot separately, assigning each plot to a variable, and then arranging them next to each other using **grid.arrange** from the **gridExtra**-package. 

It can also be created using what is called a 'pipe operator' (**%>%**), which is a function from within the **tidyverse**-package, and with a little help from the **data.table**-package. The pipe operator is a nice tool to reduce the amount of code and variable names needed, and can be used for a lot of different stuff. For example, **filter** can be used to select specific rows, as is done here, where we select rows in column 'Question', that include the text 'like', and as the questions about liking are the only questions containing this text, these are the rows selected.

To learn more about the pipe operator, see [Edit using Tidyverse]. Here, there is also an explanation of the other functions such as **pivot_longer**.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(data4consumerscience)

data(pasta)

ggplot(data = pasta, aes(x = Did_you_consider_the_proteincontent_of_the_dishes_you_choose)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  facet_wrap(~factor(Day))

#Arranging to plots together
library(gridExtra)

legumes <- ggplot(data = pasta, aes(x = I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle('Legumes - liking')

mushrooms <- ggplot(data = pasta, aes(x = I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_mushrooms)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle('Mushrooms - liking')

grid.arrange(legumes,mushrooms, nrow = 1)

#The fancy way:
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

pasta %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes:Pasta_with_mushrooms_is_visually_appealing, names_to = 'Question',
         values_to = 'Answer',
         ) %>%
  filter(., Question %like% 'like') %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = Answer)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~Question)

```

Another nice plot is a bivariate plot, plotting two variables against each other and adding a regression line (using **geom_smooth()**, and specifying `method = 'lm'` for a linear regression for `formula = 'y ~ x')`. This has been done below, to see if there is a correlation between the liking and the rating of the visual appearance for pasta with legumes:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = pasta, aes(x = Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing, y = I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = 'y ~ x')
```

### Linear model for buffet data

You can also create a linear regression model explaining the relationship between liking and visual apperance, as is done below using the **lm()**-function. 

```{r}
mdl <- lm(data = pasta, I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes ~ Pasta_with_legumes_is_visually_appealing)
summary(mdl)
```

The **summary()**-function will give a lot of information about the model, e.g. the p-value, which is much lower than 0.05 (it is 2.36e-16), showing that  the visual rating and the liking are indeed highly correlated. Also, the estimates of the summary are in fact the estimates of the parameters of the regression line, that follows
$y = a + b\cdot x$. The estimate is: $\hat{y}=0.82677 \cdot x \ + 1.08609$. Have a look at the plot and see if it fits with the regression line we created before. To learn more about linear models, see [Normal and Mixed models]

### Post-hoc test for survey data
One can also investigate whether two or more discrete groups are different from one another. The model is created the same way as above for the linear model, with the exception that our x is now discrete (`Why_did_you_consider_the_proteincontent`).

A very useful outcome of a model like this is the pairwise comparison between groups - in this case the different considerations about the protein content of the dish. The pairwise comparison compares all the groups (here the considerations), and the result is a letter assigned to each group. If two groups have different letters, the two groups are significantly different from each other, whereas if two groups have the same letter, they are not.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(multcomp)
pasta$Why_did_you_consider_the_proteincontent <- as.factor(pasta$Why_did_you_consider_the_proteincontent)

model <- lm(data = pasta, I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes ~ Why_did_you_consider_the_proteincontent)

cld(glht(model, linfct = mcp(Why_did_you_consider_the_proteincontent = "Tukey")))
```

In our case, the consideration about protein content did not affect the liking of pasta with legumes, as all groups have been assigned with the same letter. For more information on the post-hoc test, see [Post hoc test - Tukey's Honest Significant Difference].

## Combining consumption and survey data

It is of course interesting to investigate how the consumption and the survey correlate. One example of how to look at this can be seen below. First, the data from the 'Pasta with legumes'-station are plotted in a bivariate plot, where consumption is plotted against liking of pasta with legumes.

Next, a linear model is created to test whether the correlation is significant, and to see the estimates.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#Bivariate plot
ggplot(data = pasta[pasta$StationName=='Pasta with legumes',], aes(x = I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes, y = Consumption)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = 'y ~ x')

#Model
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
fullmodel <- pasta %>%
  filter(.,StationName %like% 'legumes') %>%
  lm(data = ., Consumption ~ I_like_taste_of_pasta_with_legumes)
summary(fullmodel)
```

The model shows, that indeed, the liking of pasta with legumes affects the consumption of pasta with legumes (as the p-value is 0.00205, which is below 0.05).

Also shown are the estimates of the regression: $\hat{y}= 33.859\cdot x \ -46.740$

## PCA on survey answers

We use the ggbiplot package for plotting the PCA model (See [Biplot] for details). 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbiplot)
```


### Wrangle data

PCA takes numerical data as input, so we use the likert-scales in the form of 1 to 7. 
Further the yes/no answers are included, and also needs to be changed.



```{r}
data('pasta')
x <- pasta %>% 
  mutate(Did_you_take_food_from_both_Dish1_and_Dish2 = 
           Did_you_take_food_from_both_Dish1_and_Dish2 %>% factor %>% as.numeric(),
         Did_you_consider_the_proteincontent_of_the_dishes_you_choose = 
           Did_you_consider_the_proteincontent_of_the_dishes_you_choose %>% 
           factor() %>% as.numeric()) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric) %>% 
  filter(Day==1) %>%  # the survey part is the same for both days and both stations. That is what we keep. 
  filter(str_detect(StationName,'leg'))
```

### Build the model

```{r}
PCAmdl <- prcomp(x[,c(5:6,8:11)],scale. = T)
```

### Bi-plot 

And a plot of the model

```{r,fig.height=6}
ggbiplot(PCAmdl, varname.size = 5) + ylim(c(-4,4)) + xlim(c(-2,5))
```

What does component 1 (PC1) reflect? What does PC2 reflect?

Lets plot the model and color the samples according to the consumption (of legumes) cutted at the median.

```{r,fig.height=6}
ggbiplot(PCAmdl, groups = factor(x$Consumption>130), ellipse = T,
         varname.size = 5) + ylim(c(-4,4)) + xlim(c(-3,5))
```

### Extract the components and run all associations. 

We are interested in if any of the likert/survey traits reflected by PCA is correlated with consumption. 
It is a little complicated, but here goes

```{r}
library(broom)
library(broom.mixed)
library(lme4)

scores <- data.frame(Person = x$Person, PCAmdl$x[,1:2]) # take out the first two components. 
tbmixed <- pasta %>% 
  left_join(scores, by = 'Person') %>% 
  gather(comp,score,PC1:PC2) %>% 
  group_by(StationName,comp) %>% 
  do(lmer(data = ., Consumption~score + Day + (1|Person)) %>% tidy(conf.int = T))
```

... Make a table and a plot of the results. 

```{r}
library(knitr)
tbmixed %>% 
  filter(term=='score') %>%
  dplyr::select(-effect,-group) %>% 
  kable(x = .,caption = 'Slopes according to components', digits = 2, format = 'simple')

tbmixed %>% 
  filter(term=='score') %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(comp,estimate,ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.1) +geom_point()+ 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  facet_grid(~StationName) + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

Interpret the results.

# Intro to large survey data

The data used in this chapter are based on surveys conducted during earlier iterations of the courses *Food Consumer Research and Meal Consumer Research*.

Large survey data can be collected using SurveyXact. 
There are tools (packages for R) which can import SurveyXact outputs directly, while we do not go through these here, googl'ing a bit may be helpful. 
Alternatively, the SurveyXact files can be exported to .xlsx files and imported as indicated in [How to import data].

Here we have included the data in the data4consumerscience package ready for use. 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("fmcrsurvey")
```

### Looking at the data and checking formating 

The functions **head()**, **View()**, and **str()** can be used to get an overview of formating. See [Looking at the imported elements] for details. 

A fair bunch of the variables are characters (chr) because they are recorded as levels on a likert-scale. However, you may want to also have those as numeric values from $1$ to $5$ or $7$. The code below does the job. 

The key thing to note here is that if the factor levels are *not* specified, then they will be ordered according to the alphabet. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# The coloumns in the dataset which are 7 point likert-scales
cols <- colnames(fmcrsurvey)[7:10]
# Use the mutate_at() function to make the variables into factors, and setting the levels in the right order.
fmcrsurvey <- fmcrsurvey %>% 
  mutate_at(cols, funs(factor(.,ordered = T, 
                              levels = c('Disagree extremely',
                                         'Disagree',
                                         'Disagree slightly',
                                         'Neutral',
                                         'Agree slightly',
                                         'Agree',
                                         'Agree extremely'))))

# The coloumns in the dataset which are 5 point likert-scales
cols <- colnames(fmcrsurvey)[11:17]
fmcrsurvey <- fmcrsurvey %>% 
  mutate_at(cols, funs(factor(.,ordered = T, 
                              levels = c('Completely disagree',
                                         'Disagree',
                                         'Neither disagree nor agree',
                                         'Agree',
                                         'Completely agree'))))

# Other coloumns which are naturally ordered
fmcrsurvey$Freq_Groceries <- factor(fmcrsurvey$Freq_Groceries, ordered = T, 
                           levels = c('1-3 times per month',"Once a week","6-2 times per week","Every day"))


fmcrsurvey$Pay_large_water_melon <- factor(fmcrsurvey$Pay_large_water_melon,ordered = T, levels = c('0-10 DKK','10-20 DKK','20-30 DKK','30-40 DKK','40 DKK and above'))

```

## Descriptive statistics

For reporting the results of a survey it is important to characterize the cohort/population who were used. This, inorder for others to be able to generalize the results. I.e. will certain insights obtained for a group of mostly young females also apply for the general population etc. For this descriptive statistics is used. For more general details see [Descriptive statistics] 

In the dataset we have asked for the Age, height, Weight, Gender, WhereGroceries and DietaryPreferences of the consumers. There are different ways to analyse thease background variables depending on the nature of the data. 

### Numeric values

As an example we have *Age*. It is a numeric variable, and also continuous.  

We want to calculate mean, median, standard deviation and IQR

```{r}
mean(fmcrsurvey$Age)
sd(fmcrsurvey$Age)
median(fmcrsurvey$Age)
IQR(fmcrsurvey$Age)
```

... or simply use the summary() function, to get all the above answers in one go: 

```{r}
summary(fmcrsurvey$Age)
```

Use the above mention codes for all continuous variables. 

## Plots

It is a good idea to plot data. This is a natural first step to look for distributions and find odd behaving samples / miss-registrations.  

Below are some relevant examples. To see more, go to [Plotting data].

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Age, fill = Gender)) + geom_histogram(position = 'dodge')
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(x= 1, Age)) + geom_boxplot()+ facet_wrap(~Gender)

```


### Within groups of data

The flat calculations - across the entire dataset as a single group, is seldom very informative. We usually want to compare numbers between different groups. 

As an example we use *How much you would pay for a banana* in reference to the gender: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Gender, Pay_organic_banana)) + geom_boxplot()
```

... If you want to cross with several variables (Try to evaluate the code your self): 

```{r, eval=FALSE,include=T}
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Gender, Pay_organic_banana, fill = DietaryPreferences)) + guides(fill=guide_legend(title = "Diet")) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

Another useful function is the **aggregate**-function, which can be used to apply a function (e.g., taking the mean) according to a specified condition. In the below example, the sex of the participants is used. The function then groups rows with the same sex, and calculates the mean for each group.

```{r}
aggregate(fmcrsurvey$Pay_organic_banana, 
          by = list(fmcrsurvey$Gender), mean)

aggregate(fmcrsurvey$Pay_organic_banana, 
          by = list(fmcrsurvey$Gender), sd)
```

Try to do these for some of the other variables.

## Categorical / Ordinal variables

Below are some examples of plots that work well when you work with categorical data. For more info on plotting, see [Plotting data].

```{r}
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Gender)) + geom_bar()
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Gender, fill = Freq_Groceries)) + geom_bar()
ggplot(data = fmcrsurvey, aes(Gender, fill = Freq_Groceries)) + geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
```


### Tables

The **table()** and **prop.table()** functions are your friends, as they help you get to know you data better. Try and see what the different inputs give as resulting output, and see what happens if you change variables.

```{r}
table(fmcrsurvey$Gender)
table(fmcrsurvey$Gender, fmcrsurvey$Freq_Groceries)
prop.table(table(fmcrsurvey$Gender, fmcrsurvey$Freq_Groceries), 1)
```

## Table 1

There are some nice packages in R which can do the job for you in terms of organizing tables. An especially nice one is the one called **tableone**, which will help create tables almost ready for publication, if given the right inputs. Below are some examples of how the package could be used, using the same dataset as the rest of the chapter.

Here is how to install the package:

```{r,eval=F}
install.packages('tableone')
```

Below is one way of using tableone, which will give information about the amount of participants in each group.

```{r}
library(tableone)
CreateTableOne(data = fmcrsurvey, vars = c('Gender','Age', 'Freq_Groceries','I_am_able_to_prepare_a_soup'))
```

... below if split into groups:

```{r}
CreateTableOne(data = fmcrsurvey, vars = c('Age', 'Freq_Groceries','I_am_able_to_prepare_a_soup'), 
               strata = c('Gender','Freq_Groceries'))
```

If you want to do it on a large set of variables then it might be convenient to extract the names without having to type all in: 

```{r, eval = F}
varnames <- colnames(fmcrsurvey)[2:10]
CreateTableOne(data = fmcrsurvey, vars = varnames, 
               strata = 'Gender')

```

Try to play around with these codes to see if it makes sense what is presented.

## The tidyverse way

If the datasets get to large, or the work feels too tedious, there's a way around that - the **tidyverse**-way. **tidyverse** is a large framework build in R, that lets you do almost everything with data. For example it uses what is called the pipe operator: **%>%**. For more information, see [Edit using Tidyverse].

Now, let's look at all *Likert-scale* variables in plots and numbers:

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("fmcrsurvey")
fmcrsurvey %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = I_will_only_buy_products_at_a_reduced_price:I_am_able_to_prepare_a_soup, names_to = 'var', values_to = 'y') %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(y)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~var) + coord_flip()

```

Some of the levels added doesn't fit with the columns, which yields the mediocre result above. One will have to either align the levels, or make separate plots for each group of levels. 

Aligning can be done in different ways, e.g., in R and in Excel, but in our case, since the questions do not have the same number of levels, it seems more appropriate to create two different plots, to ensure that no information is lost.

The **reorder_levels**-function from the **rstatix**-package ensures, that the levels appear in the desired order on the plot.

```{r}
library(rstatix)
fmcrsurvey %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = I_will_only_buy_products_at_a_reduced_price:I_am_always_updated_on_the_latest_food_trends, names_to = 'var',values_to = 'y') %>%
  reorder_levels(data = ., name = 'y', order = c('Disagree extremely',
                                         'Disagree',
                                         'Disagree slightly',
                                         'Neutral',
                                         'Agree slightly',
                                         'Agree',
                                         'Agree extremely')) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(y,fill = Gender)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~var) + coord_flip()

fmcrsurvey %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = I_will_only_buy_products_at_a_reduced_price:I_am_able_to_prepare_a_soup, names_to = 'var',values_to = 'y') %>% 
  reorder_levels(data = ., name = 'y', 
                 order = c('Completely disagree',
                           'Disagree',
                           'Neither disagree nor agree',
                           'Agree',
                           'Completely agree')) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(y,fill = Gender)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~var) + coord_flip()
```

# Consumer segmentation

The data used in the first part of this chapter is from the paper: *Verbeke, Wim, Federico JA PÃ©rez-Cueto, and Klaus G. Grunert. "To eat or not to eat pork, how frequently and how varied? Insights from the quantitative Q-PorkChains consumer survey in four European countries." Meat science 88.4 (2011): 619-626.* and can be found in the *data4consumerscience*-package as **pork**. 


```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(pork)
```

## Segmentation

To create the consumer segments, a cluster analysis, based on behavioral data (frequency and variety of consumption), will be carried out. 

This example shows k-means clustering as the clustering analysis, but there are many more options out there - some more data-driven and some using common sense or domain knowledge. Both types of segmentation can be valid, as long as the scientific reasoning behind makes sense.

### Using K-means for clustering

K-means is a popular algorithm used for clustering, which is a fancy word for grouping. This means, that we can group un-grouped data, if the different attributes create such groups.

The algorithm works by you selecting a value for "k," which is the number of clusters/groups that the algorithm will attempt to group the data points into. Then, it randomly selects "k" points from the dataset as the initial centroids. These centroids represent the centers of each cluster.

Next, the algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on the squared Euclidean distance between the point and the centroid (also known as the "Within Cluster Sum of Squares"(WCSS)). After all data points have been assigned, the centroid for each cluster is recalculated by taking the mean of all the points assigned to that cluster. This step updates the center of each cluster.

The algorithm repeats the previous two steps until the centroids no longer move or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The final result is a set of "k" clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the closest centroid.

K-means in R is pretty simple - only one line of code is needed to perform the analysis, if the data are ready for analysis.

First, we **set.seed**. As k-means is an iterative algorithm, that starts in a random point, it matters where this point is. Usually, the only thing happening if the seed is changed, is that the order of the clusters change - but this can be annoying enough that you would want to avoid it! To ensure, that we get the same results every time we run the algorithm, we set the seed, and keep it that way throughout the analysis.

As a start, we only use two variables (specified in the code as "VarietyTotal" & "TotalPorkWeek", from the dataset *pork*), as this is easy to interpret. 
Below is shown an example with both 2 and 3 clusters ("centers = _"). 

The "nstart"-input specifies, that the clustering will start at 25 different random points, and selects the best. Doing this will help getting the same result every time, especially if data are less clustered by nature. For details on the algorithm type *?kmeans* to get help. 

Note, the *set.seed(123)* is only for reproducibility and hence only nice-to-know.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
km.cluster3 <- kmeans(pork[, c("VarietyTotal", "TotalPorkWeek")], centers = 3,nstart = 25)
km.cluster2 <- kmeans(pork[, c("VarietyTotal", "TotalPorkWeek")], centers = 2,nstart = 25)
```

First, we run a clustering with the function *kmeans* for the dataset *pork*. We will use the two variables "VarietyTotal" & "TotalPorkWeek" to calculate the three best clusters, and we will choose the random centers 25 times, by specifying the argument *nstart*. You can off course change this number yourself. We save it as *km.cluster3* (remember you choose this name). Secondly, we run almost the same clustering, changing only the name and the number of centers to 2. 


### Initial characterization of clusters

Below are some of the outputs, that you can get from the clustering. Here you can see the size of the clusters as well as the positions of their centroids. Positions here means the value of the centroid for each variable. For example, below we see, that the cluster 1's centriod has a value for VarietyTotal of 25.04562. Size means the number of members in each cluster.

Here for 3 clusters:


```{r}
km.cluster3$centers
km.cluster3$size

```

... and for 2 clusters:

```{r}
km.cluster2$centers
km.cluster2$size
```


Centers will give you the average values for the variables "VarietyTotal" & "TotalPorkWeek" in the center of each of the three (in km.cluster3) clusters. Size will give you the the number of members per cluster. It is a good idea to check that the clusters are not too uneven in number of members. The third line above is just another way of asking for the size of the clusters in km.cluster3. All command are repeated for the km.cluster2; that is the cluster analysis with two clusters, you made and saved above. 


### Vizualization of the clusters

It is, however, a lot easier to understand clustering, when it is visualized. Below is shown two different ways of plotting the clusters - one using the build-in plotting function, and one using the package **ggplot2**. **ggplot2** maybe looks a bit more complicated, but has a lot of functions built into it, which means that it can be nice to learn!

Try to make the plots yourself, and try to see what happens if you change different inputs.

**Using Basic R-plotting**
```{r}
plot(TotalPorkWeek ~ VarietyTotal, data = pork, col = km.cluster3[["cluster"]] + 1)
points(km.cluster3[["centers"]], pch = 20, cex = 1.3)
```

The first line creates a scatter plot, by plotting the variables *TotalPorkWeek* on the y-axis and *VarietyTotal* on the x-axis.
*points()* function adds the cluster centers as points from the *km.clusters3* object to the existing scatter plot. The *pch* argument specifies the point type, and the *cex* argument controls the size of the point. 

**Using ggplot2 with 3 centers**

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(km.cluster3[["centers"]])
df2 <- data.frame(km.cluster2[["centers"]])

#ggplot 2
ggplot(data = pork, aes(x = VarietyTotal, y = TotalPorkWeek)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(km.cluster3$cluster))) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend('Cluster')) + 
  geom_point(data = df, 
             aes(x = VarietyTotal, y = TotalPorkWeek), 
             color = 'black', 
             size = 2) + 
  theme_linedraw()
```
When using ggplot2, as data frame is needed. Therefore two data frames a made, one for each of the centers from the clustering objects previously made.
*ggplot* creates a scatter plot using the *pork* data, with the variables *TotalPorkWeek* on the y-axis and *VarietyTotal* on the x-axis.
*geom_point()* adds the first layer of points. These points are colored according to the clusters in *km.cluster3*. *factor()* is used to ensure that the cluster variable is treated as a categorical variable. 
*guides()* modifies the legend title for the color guide in the plot. It changes the legend title to "Cluster."
*geom_point()* adds the second layer of points to the plot using the df data frame. These points represent the cluster centers. 

**Using ggplot2 with 2 centers**
```{r}
ggplot(data = pork, aes(x = VarietyTotal, y = TotalPorkWeek)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(km.cluster2$cluster))) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend('Cluster')) + 
  geom_point(data = df2, 
             aes(x = VarietyTotal, y = TotalPorkWeek), 
             color = 'black', 
             size = 2) + 
  theme_linedraw()
```
The method for creating the ggplot with 2 centers, is the same, only changing the data frame being used, when adding the second layer of points. 

### Sums of Squares from the clustering

As mentioned in [K-means], k-means set the clusters such that the between clusters (sort of differences between centers) are *large* while the distance within a cluster (from each sample to is cluster-center) is *small*.

R can also display these numbers, as shown below:

```{r}
#Within Sum of Squares
km.cluster3$withinss
#Total Within Sum of Squares
km.cluster3$tot.withinss
#Between Sum of Squares
km.cluster3$betweenss
```

## Selecting the number of clusters - a data-driven approach

Usually there is no given set of clusters, so we want to also learn that from data. 


Below we show how to use the Gap-statistics (from the **cluster**-package) for $2$ up to $10$ clusters to select the optimal number of clusters.

The concept of Gap statistics is based on the idea that if a dataset truly contains distinct clusters, then the dispersion within each cluster should be smaller than the dispersion between clusters. The gap statistic measures the difference between the observed dispersion and the expected dispersion under a null reference distribution. By comparing this gap statistic for different numbers of clusters, one can identify the optimal number of clusters that best captures the underlying structure of the data.

You don't need to fully understand how it works, but you have to know how to interpret the plot, to be able to decide the number of clusters.

When interpreting the plot, the highest Gap-value (the y-axis) shows the number of clusters, that best represent the data. However, since we are trying to use the data to as a generalization of a larger population, one should be conservative when choosing the number of clusters. If a less complicated/more general model (less clusters) can explain almost the same, one should always choose the less complicated model. 

As a rule of thumb, when interpreting the Gap-statistics plot, a model with a number of clusters within the standard deviation of the model with the best Gap-statistic will be sufficient. In our case, this means, that a model with 3 clusters should do the job, as seen below.

Another check is of course to make both models, and plot it, to check if the clustering makes sense. This is equally as important as looking at the Gap-statistics.

```{r}
library(cluster)
gapStatistic <- clusGap(pork[, c("VarietyTotal", "TotalPorkWeek")], kmeans, 10)

plot(gapStatistic, main = "")
```
The package *cluster* is initially loaded. The gap statistics is then calculated using the function *clusGap()*, with the data *pork* and only containing the columns *TotalPorkWeek* and *VarietyTotal*, *kmeans* is used as the clustering algorithm. The *10* specifies that the analysis is performed for up to 10 clusters. The *plot()* function is then used to plot the results.

The point at which the gap statistic starts to level off or decrease can provide insight into the appropriate number of clusters to use for the data. Therefore the appropiate number of clusters seems to be $10$

**Using Nbclust**

Another package able to aid when trying to determine the number of clusters is **NbClust**. This package runs a variety of different tests, each resulting in an optimal number of clusters. This means, that while you get a lot of opinion on the number of clusters, the *NbClust*-function might take a while to run.

*NbClust* will show a lot of plots and show results for the different methods. You can look at them if you want, but the most important part is the last output of the function, where the voting for the different number of clusters as well as the conclusion is displayed.

```{r}
library(NbClust)
Nbclusters <- NbClust(pork[, c("VarietyTotal", "TotalPorkWeek")], method = 'kmeans' )
```

The gap-statistics seems to suggest k=3, whereas NbClust suggests k=2-4, which shows how important it is, that you know your data enough to be able to make the right decision, such as number of clusters.

The rule of thumb is to use these data driven approaches together with interpretability of the resulting clusters, such that the solution is meaningful. 

## Segmentation - another example

The data **plantbaseddiet** constitute data from the following study, and can be found in the **data4consumerscience**-package: 

*Reipurth, Malou FS, Lasse HÃ¸rby, Charlotte G. Gregersen, Astrid Bonke, and Federico JA Perez Cueto. "Barriers and facilitators towards adopting a more plant-based diet in a sample of Danish consumers." Food quality and preference 73 (2019): 288-292.*

These we will use as a second example for cluster analysis. 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(plantbaseddiet)
```

### Cluster analysis 

In this example, 3 variables are included in the clustering: 'a_meat', 'a_dairy' and 'a_eggs'. Otherwise, the same procedure applies: Finding the appropriate amount of clusters, and running the analysis.

```{r}
library(cluster)
library(NbClust)

gapStatistic <- clusGap(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')], kmeans, 10)
plot(gapStatistic, main = "")

Nbclusters_plant <- NbClust(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')],method = 'kmeans' )

set.seed(123)
res <- kmeans(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')], centers = 4, nstart = 25)

```

### Plot the model using PCA

The thing is, that now that we are dealing with more than 2 dimensions, it can be harder to visualize, how well the clustering has worked. One way though, is to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as PCA aims to describe the most variance from the data as possible, in the fewest dimensions as possible. This means, that if indeed the clusters are a result of variation in the data, a PCA should show it.

For more information on PCA, see [Introduction to PCA and multivariate data].

A PCA with the same data as the clustering is created (using the **prcomp**) and plotted (using **ggbiplot**)

```{r}
library(ggbiplot)

PCAmdl <- prcomp(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')], center = T, scale. = F)
ggbiplot(PCAmdl, groups = factor(res$cluster), ellipse = T)
```

### Add to dataset

As the clustering is a characteristic for each sample, similar to age, gender, name,... we can simply add it to the dataset. 
Here the interpretation from above gives rise to some intuitive names. These can be used directly. Here is how to add it to the dataset:

```{r}
#First, check the centriods, to see if they make sense.
res$centers

#Then matched the label names, according to the plot above.
plantbaseddiet$clusters <- factor(res$cluster,labels = c('High Meat','Low All','High Dairy','High All'))

#And here the plot, now with the right labels.
ggbiplot(PCAmdl, groups = plantbaseddiet$clusters, ellipse = T)
```


### Comments

* Try to investigate if the number of clusters using gab-statistics and extract between and within variances.

* Plot the different versions using PCA.

# Profiling segments

```{r, include=F, echo=FALSE}
# __Den her og logistisk regression kom jeg lidt mere til kort, jeg kunne ikke lige helt knÃ¦kke koden til hvordan det bedst bliver struktureret. SÃ¥ det der er herinde nu, er kopieret + rettet lidt til og flyttet rundt, men er reelt det som stÃ¥r i de to .rmd-filer som hedder noget med Profiling_Segments og Logistic_regression, som blev brugt i kurset sidste Ã¥r. Koden virker, men rÃ¦kkefÃ¸lgen og den rÃ¸de trÃ¥d er der hvor det halter.__
```

There are many ways of profiling consumer segments. Some of the most widely used are shown in this chapter, as well as in the chapter [Logistic Regression].

The data in this chapter constitute data from the following study. 

*Reipurth, Malou FS, Lasse HÃ¸rby, Charlotte G. Gregersen, Astrid Bonke, and Federico JA Perez Cueto. "Barriers and facilitators towards adopting a more plant-based diet in a sample of Danish consumers." Food quality and preference 73 (2019): 288-292.* and can be found in the **data4consumerscience**-package as **plantbaseddiet**.

The same order of operation regarding clustering will be followed here as in [Consumer segmentation].

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(plantbaseddiet)

set.seed(123)

res <- kmeans(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')],centers =  4)
res$centers

plantbaseddiet$clusters <- factor(res$cluster,
                        labels = c('High Meat','Low all','High Dairy','High All'))
```

The dataset from the data4consumerscience package is loaded into the R environment. set.seed(123) sets a seed for generating random numbers, resulting in the k-means cluster analysis being reproducible, that is when running the k-means cluster analysis multiple times R will produce the same results.

The *kmeans()* function performs the k-means cluster analysis, using the variables a_meat, a_dairy and a_eggs as input, while "centers" specifies the number of centers to be created. _res$centers_ retrieves the cluster centers and the values represent the average values of the variables for each cluster e.g. Cluster 1 has an average value of 18.81 for a_meat.

The last line adds a new variable "clusters" to the "plantbaseddiet" dataset. The "res$cluster" contains the cluster assignment for each observation (in this case participant). The factor is used to convert the cluster assignments into factor levels, corresponding to the labels "High Meat", "Low all", "High Dairy", "High All". Meaning cluster "1" will be assigned "High Meat", in alignment with the result from earlier. 

## Table 1 as a profiling tool

Table 1 in this study is a descriptive representation of the clusters, and hence is indeed a profiling of the segments, as it shows a nice overview of the socio-demographic distribution between clusters.

Recall the **tableone**-package from [Table 1]. Below is code, that can lead you on the right track to mimic the table in the study. What variables are missing from the Table 1 of the study?

```{r}
library(tableone)
tb1 <- CreateTableOne(data = plantbaseddiet,
                      strata = 'clusters', 
                      vars = c('gender','age'))

print(tb1, cramVars = 'gender', nonnormal = 'age')
```

## Visualization of Consumer Segments

We use Correspondence Analysis. In principle just a PCA model for count data. 

You do not need to know all the details behind Correspondence Analysis. But it is a rather useful tool as a graphical supplement to the tabular characterization.   

## Creating the contingency table

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

X <- plantbaseddiet %>% 
  mutate(agegrp = cut(age, breaks = quantile(age), include.lowest = T)) %>%
  gather(demo,demoval, gender,agegrp,city:income) %>%
  mutate(demoval = paste(demo,demoval,sep = '='))

conttb <- table(X$demoval,X$clusters)

conttb
```

The package "tidyverse" is used to create a contingency table from the "plantbaseddiet" dataset. The first use of the "mutate" function is used to create a new variable "agegrp". The "cut" function is used to create age groups by dividing the age into quantiles breaks. The "include.lowest" is set to "TRUE" to include the lowest value in the first age group. 
The "gather" function is then used to gather the variables "gender", "agegrp" and variables from "city" to "income" into two new variables "demo" and "demoval". This reshapes the data from a wide format to a long format, resulting in the variable "demo" containing the variable names and the variable "demoval" containing the corresponding values. 
The second use of the "mutate" function combines the values in "demo" and "demoval" seperated by a "=" into the variable "demoval". Meaning if "demo" is gender and "demoval" is Male. The resulting "demoval" would be "gender=Male"

The contingency table is then created using the "Table" function. In this case "demoval" is used as rows, and "clusters" as columns. 

If you consider the row for children=1, Based on the contingency table results provided above, you can see that out of the participants who have 1 child, 35 participants are assigned to the cluster "High Meat", 165 participants are assigned to the cluster "Low All", and so on. Similarly, for other categories such as children=2, children=3, etc.

## Plot the numbers

Here is a simple visual representation of the numbers 

```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=7, fig.align='center'}
library("gplots")
# 1. convert the data as a table
dt <- as.table(as.matrix(conttb))
# 2. Graph
balloonplot(t(dt), main ="Demographics of Meat/Dairy segments", xlab ="", ylab="",
            label = F, show.margins = F)
```

To further visualize the results from the contingency table, one can use a balloonplot. First the results from the contingency table has to be converted into a table. The package "gplots" is used for creating the balloonplot. In the balloonplot, the dataframe dt is transposed to satisfy the needs of the balloonplot function. The arguments "label" and "show.margins" are set to "FALSE" to hide labels and margins for a cleaner plot. 

The interpretation is straight forward. The bigger the circle, the higher the frequencies. e.g. as for the previous section participants with 1 child, the circle is smaller for the cluster "High Meat" corresponding to 35 in the contingency table compared to the cluster "Low All" with a much bigger circle corresponding to 165 in the contingency table. 

## Contingency table

There is another option for assessing differences between 2x2 categorical data using Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test. Although these methods essentially answers the same question: Name if there is differences in cluster membership given a binary explanatory variable. The methods are less general, as we can not account for confounders. Here we show the computation of those test using gender as explanatory variable on cluster 1 membership using a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(pork)

table2x2 <- table(pork$Gender, pork$cluster1)
table2x2

prop.table(table2x2, margin = 1)  
# 1 stands for row-wise percentages
```

### Pearson Chi-square test

Pearson's Chi-square test applied to the contingency table. 
This test is used here to answer whether there are differences in distribution of counts between several clusters. 

For instance, the gender distribution as seen in the figure above indicates a higher relative proportion of females in the **Low All** cluster. This observation can be tested. 


```{r}
conttb[16:17,]
chisq.test(conttb[16:17,],correct = F)
```

The results indicates that gender indeed affects the cluster membership. 

## Correspondence Analysis 

In order to globally extract relations between clusters and demographics, correspondence analysis (CA) is a useful tool by which major trends in the data are visualized. Interpretation follows how biplots of PCA models are interpreted. See [Interpreting model output] in the chapter on PCA. 


```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=7, fig.align='center'}
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)

res.ca <- CA(conttb, graph = FALSE)
fviz_ca_biplot(res.ca, repel = TRUE)
```

Reading the CA plot is pretty simple. Those demographic characteristics in the direction of  position of the cluster is positively associated with that cluster / segment. 

E.g. 

**High all** is associated with children 4 and 5, household 5, income 5 and age from $30$ - $40.8$  
* **Low all** is children 1, education 5, females etc. 

<!--chapter:end:11_ProfilingSegments.Rmd-->

# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is regression towards a binary response. 
In short regression were developed towards continuous responses, and is what is supported in R using the *lm()* function. However, there exits other type of responses, including binary, counts, etc. where the aim of the statistical analysis is still to use a regression type of model. This has given rise to the use of generalized linear models, where several response types can be analysis in a regression framework. In R this is done using the *glm()* function, extended with a specification of the response type using the _family_ argument. 

Logistic regression aims to model the probability of observing case (versus control) given the input. The outputs from such a model is odds ratios. 

This video takes you through some basics. If you want to dive directly at logistic regression, then dive in from *6.53*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vembedr::embed_youtube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4N3_XJJ-jU")
# vembedr::embed_youtube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBqdQekpR5M")
# vembedr::embed_youtube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOYt84ZPTx0&list=PL4L59zaizb3FmBdxuDLRdzGsknTrZN6Ys")
# vembedr::embed_youtube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4N3_XJJ-jU&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566&index=3")
```


In this chapter, we are going to use logistic regression for characterizing clusters. This is simply done by constructing binary classes based on the clusters as **belong to cluster k** versus **not belong to cluster k**. Even with more than two clusters binary endpoints can be constructed in this way. Alternatively, if there is one of the clusters which naturally is a reference cluster, then comparing the individual clusters to this one is also a way forward.  

The data used in this chapter is from the paper: *Verbeke, Wim, Federico JA PÃ©rez-Cueto, and Klaus G. Grunert. "To eat or not to eat pork, how frequently and how varied? Insights from the quantitative Q-PorkChains consumer survey in four European countries." Meat science 88.4 (2011): 619-626.* and can be found in the *data4consumerscience*-package as *pork*. 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data(pork)
```

## Segmentation/Clustering

In the dataset there are three clusters encoded as binary membership variables: cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3. They are mutually exclusive. 

These clusters are based on another clustering procedure than k-means, but in principle any clustering can be used to generate clusters... as long as they are meaningful. 

Here we just plot them to see how they appear on the two variables used for their construction.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4.5}
library(ggplot2)
library(tableone)

pork$clusters <- pork$cluster1*1 + 
  pork$cluster2*2 + 
  pork$cluster3*3  
  
plot(TotalPorkWeek ~ VarietyTotal, data = pork, 
     col = pork[["clusters"]] + 1)

#Or using ggplot2:
ggplot(data = pork, aes(x = VarietyTotal, y = TotalPorkWeek,color = factor(clusters))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  guides(color = guide_legend('Cluster')) + 
  theme_linedraw()
```


```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=4.5, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#5 points are missing a classification 
which(is.na(pork$clusters), arr.ind=TRUE)

tb1 <- CreateTableOne(data = pork, 
                      strat = 'clusters', 
                      vars = c('COUNTRY','Locality','Gender','Age','education'))
print(tb1)

```


## Fitting the logistic regression-model

The question we are going to adress here is _is gender related to the being in cluster 1?_. Other tools for this is covered in [Profiling segments], but here we will see how logistic regression can be used for this. 

```{r}
pork[["Gender"]] <- as.factor(pork[["Gender"]])
# 1: Male, 2: Female

## Fitting logistic model
logreg.1.gender <- glm(cluster1 ~ factor(Gender), data = pork, family = binomial)
summary(logreg.1.gender)
```

This model indicates Gender is related to cluster1 as the p-value is highly significant.

## Probabilities of segment membership:

One way to get the direction is to interpret the coefficients from the summary() output, but alternatively, simply using the model to predict membership probabilities will give similar insight. 

Here the probability of beloging to cluster 1 is predicted for the situation where Gender is $1$ as well as $2$. Be aware that such predictions should match with the data source used for building the model. Here that means, that if Gender is encoded with numbers (1 or 2), then the predictions are likewise done usign those. If the Gender is encoded with _male_ and _female_, then that it the inputs when doing predictions. 

```{r}
predict(logreg.1.gender, data.frame(Gender = "1"), 
        type = "response")

predict(logreg.1.gender, data.frame(Gender = "2"), 
        type = "response")
```

What we see it that the probablity of belonging to cluster1 is higher if the Gender is $1$ (in reference to $2$). This is obviously in line with the results in [Contingency table] and [Pearson Chi-square test] in the former chapter. 

## Odds ratios

Odds ratio is the terminology used for interpreting coefficients from a logistic regression model. 
In the direct read out of coefficients from summary() returns the natural logarithm of the oddsratio, and hence to get odds ratios the exponential function is used. 

```{r}
exp(coef(summary(logreg.1.gender))[2, 1])

exp(confint(logreg.1.gender)[2, ])
```

Here is it seen that odds of belonging to cluster1 is in favor of gender $1$ as both the estimate and its confidence bounds are above 1. 

## ORs and Probs


The odds ratio for a binary predictor is given by: 

$$ OR = \frac{p_1(1-p_2)}{(1-p_1)p2}$$

where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are probabilities of females and males respectively. 

Here we use the observed probability predictions for females and males (see *Probabilities of segment membership* above) to calculate the OR given the formula: 

```{r, eval = F, echo=T}
p1 <- 0.27
p2 <- 0.38
OR <-(p1*(1-p2))/((1-p1)*p2) # put in the ratio-calculation here
OR
```

Which is exactly the same as the output from the exponential of the coefficient in the model. 

## Effect of Age 

Logistic regression can, as normal regression, also be used with continous predictors, such as Age. 

```{r}
head(pork[, c("Age", "cluster1")])

logreg.1.age <- glm(cluster1 ~ Age, data = pork, family = binomial)

# as log(OR)
coef(summary(logreg.1.age))

# and as OR (only for the Age)
exp(coef(summary(logreg.1.age))[2,1])
```

The coefficient indicates a very weak tendency towards, that cluster1 has older individuals (the estimate is positive), but the inference for this results is very non-significant. 

## Multivariate analysis
			
Evaluating the effect of country while adjusting for age and gender. 

### Descriptives

First we look at the crude percentages of cluster1 membership for the different countries. 

```{r}
tb <- table(pork$COUNTRY, pork$cluster1)
prop.table(tb,1)
```

It seems as if especially country $4$ is higher in cluster 1 compared to the other.

### Two nested models

In order to investigate the effect of country, we make a model **with country**, and a model **without country** (But appart from that similar!). Then we compare the drop in ability to fit data using anova. This indicates whether country were an important factor. 

```{r}
pork[["COUNTRY"]] <- as.factor(pork[["COUNTRY"]])

# Model with country
logreg.1.cntr_1 <- glm(cluster1 ~  COUNTRY + Age + Gender, 
                data = pork, family = binomial)
# Model without country
logreg.1.cntr_0 <- glm(cluster1 ~ Age + Gender, 
                data = pork, family = binomial)

# Comparison
anova(logreg.1.cntr_1,logreg.1.cntr_0, test = 'Chisq')

#Or in one line of code, after defining the model WITH country:
drop1(logreg.1.cntr_1, test = "Chisq")
```

So the effect of country is strongly significant.

### Coefficients

Lets look at how similar/different the levels of education is. 

```{r}
coef(summary(logreg.1.cntr_1))
```

The estimates for *first level* of country (1) is within *(Intercept)*. 
The estimates for the remaining three levels are all **IN CONTRAST** to the intercept, and hence country 1. 

So it seems as if country 3,4 and 6 are different from country 1, but we have no idea on whether say country 3 is different from country 6 and so forth. 


### Re-level

In order to get other pairs of contrast we can re-level the factor country, and repeat the model

Here we re-level to the third level of country which is country==4. 

```{r}
pork[['COUNTRY']] <- relevel(pork[['COUNTRY']],3)
logreg.1.cntr_1a <- glm(cluster1 ~  COUNTRY + Age + Gender, 
                data = pork, family = binomial)
coef(summary(logreg.1.cntr_1a))
```

This can be repeated setting all levels as reference. But there is a more fair and easy solution.

### All pairwise comparisons

We want to compare all pairs of the $4$ country levels. This is a multiple comparison task, and can be undertaken by the **glht()** function from the **multcomp** package. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(multcomp)

summary(glht(logreg.1.cntr_1, linfct = mcp(COUNTRY = "Tukey")))

cld(glht(logreg.1.cntr_1, linfct = mcp(COUNTRY = "Tukey")))
```

Here we get all $6$ pairs of pairwise comparisons. And it appears as country 1 and 3 are not statistically different, as well as country 3 and 6 ($p>0.1$). However, country 1 and 6.

Does this compare with the percentages from the descriptive analysis? 

## Segment 2 and 3

Use the code above to conduct the same analysis for segment/cluster 2 and 3, and reveal 

* Gender differences
* Age effect
* Country differences


## A new set of data
  
The data **plantbaseddiet**, found in the **data4consumerscience**-package constitute data from the following study: 

*Reipurth, Malou FS, Lasse HÃ¸rby, Charlotte G. Gregersen, Astrid Bonke, and Federico JA Perez Cueto. "Barriers and facilitators towards adopting a more plant-based diet in a sample of Danish consumers." Food quality and preference 73 (2019): 288-292.*

Here we use the clusters from the consumer segmentation analysis as provided in [Segmentation - another example]

```{r}
rm(list =ls())
library(data4consumerscience)
data("plantbaseddiet")

set.seed(123)
res <- kmeans(plantbaseddiet[,c('a_meat', 'a_dairy','a_eggs')], 4)
res$centers

plantbaseddiet$clusters <- factor(res$cluster,labels = c('High Meat','Low all','High Dairy','High All'))

# add as binary columns
plantbaseddiet$cluster_highmeat <- as.numeric(plantbaseddiet$clusters=='High Meat')
plantbaseddiet$cluster_lowall <- as.numeric(plantbaseddiet$clusters=='Low all')
plantbaseddiet$cluster_highdairy <- as.numeric(plantbaseddiet$clusters=='High Dairy')
plantbaseddiet$cluster_highall <- as.numeric(plantbaseddiet$clusters=='High All')
```

## Logistic regression for demographic characterization

### Age 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = plantbaseddiet, aes(clusters,age)) + geom_boxplot()

mdl_age <- glm(data = plantbaseddiet, clusters=='High Meat' ~ age)

# This is essentially the same as: 
# res <- glm(data = plantbaseddiet, cluster_highmeat ~ age)

summary(mdl_age)
```

### Gender

```{r}
ggplot(data = plantbaseddiet, aes(clusters,fill = gender)) + geom_bar(position = 'dodge')

tb2 <- table(plantbaseddiet$clusters,plantbaseddiet$gender)
tb2

prop.table(tb2,margin = 1)

mdl_gender <- glm(data = plantbaseddiet, clusters=='High Meat' ~ gender)

summary(mdl_gender)

exp(coef(summary(mdl_gender))[2, 1])

```

## TASK

* Try to exchange which cluster you are looking at to see relation to age and gender
* Try to look at some other characteristics in the dataset. 
* Can you compare clusters against the variables *a_meat*, *a_dairy* or *a_eggs* using logistic regression? Why should you be cautios with interpreting these results? 


## The tidyverse way

We want to produce the results from the Table 4 in the paper. 

In principle, this table is $11$ survey likert scale answers against $4$ clusters... I.e. $44$ logistic regression models. If you do this in the traditional way it takes up tons of code, and even small changes will be time-consuming to implement. 

For instance, the first element of Table 4 is calculated as: 

```{r}
mdl <- glm(data = plantbaseddiet, clusters=='High Dairy' ~ o_prepar + age + gender + factor(education), 
           family = binomial) 

exp(coef(summary(mdl)))
exp(confint(mdl))
```

But we want all! 

So: Tidyverse and broom for the rescue!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

tb <- plantbaseddiet %>% 
  mutate(id = 1) %>% # make a vector of 1's
  spread(clusters,id, fill = 0) %>% # distribute the clustering into 4 new coloumns and make sure that the binary cluster vectors are 1 and 0. 
  gather(plant_plantbaseddiet,answ,o_prepar:o_family) %>% # long format for survey questions
  gather(cluster_type,cluster,`High Meat`:`High All`) %>% # long format for clusters 
  group_by(plant_plantbaseddiet,cluster_type) %>% # loop over all questions and all clusters
  do(glm(data = ., cluster==1 ~ answ + factor(education) + age + gender, family = binomial) %>%
       tidy(exponentiate = T,conf.int = T)) # perform logistic regression


tb %>% head()  


```

This table (tb) has all the results, with estimates being OR and with confidence intervals. However, there are *too much* information. For instance are the intercept as well as the covariates reported. We can tidy it even more:

```{r}
tb4 <- tb %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(term=='answ') %>% 
  mutate(OR = paste(round(estimate,2), 
                    ' (', round(conf.low,2),'-',
                    round(conf.high,2),')', 
                    sep = '')) %>% 
  dplyr::select(plant_plantbaseddiet,cluster_type,OR) %>% 
  spread(cluster_type,OR)
tb4  
```

Now this just needs to be exported to excel (use e.g. export() from the rio package), and a bit of **love** to be ready for a publication. 

## Comment

Try to understand each of the commands in the pipeline, what they do and why they make sense.

You can put in a hash-tag (#) before the the pipe sign (%>%) to block the pipeline and see the structure of the output at this point.

# CATA data (Check-All-That-Apply)

Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) data is in its raw form binary indicating whether a participant finds a product to have the attribute (1) or not (0).

Usually, such data is organized in a matrix where each row corresponds to the evaluation of one product by one respondent (sensory panelist, consumer or other). The columns describe the product ID/properties, respondent number and the attributes.

Say you for instance have 26 participants and 4 products, and further that all products are evaluated by all respondents once on 13 attributes. Your data matrix would then have 104 rows and 13 columns (with responses) and additionally columns indicating respondent, product, record id, date, etc.

In the CATA section of this book, we will use a data set with Beer. The data originates from Giacalone, Bredie, and FrÃ¸st (2013). They consist of evaluation of six different commercial beers from Danish craft brewers evaluated by $160$ consumers on a range of different questions:

-   Sensory properties: the consumers' response to 27 sensory descriptors (s_descriptor), some of which are super-ordinate and others more detailed. Includes information about beer and respondent. One line for each beer (6) x consumer (160) . This dataset is called *beercata*.
-   Background information: a range of questions about consumers' demography, food neophobia, beer knowledge and use, also including appropriateness ratings (a descriptor) for 27 sensory descriptors on a 7-points scale (e.g. *how appropriate do you think it is for a beer to be bitter?*). The two semantic anchors were *1 = not at all appropriate* and *7 = extremely appropriate*. This dataset is called *beerbackground*.
-   Hedonics: Their hedonic responses to the beer on a 7-point hedonic scale (1-7). This dataset is called *beerliking*.

## Importing and looking at the beer data

The data appear as a part of the data4consumerscience package (see [Import data from R-package])

We first have to import or load the data. Here is the import, remember to change the path for the Excel file to match your own settings:

```{r}
library(readxl)
beercata <- read_excel('DatasetRbook.xlsx',sheet = 'BeerCATA')
Beerbackground <- read_excel('DatasetRbook.xlsx',sheet = 'BeerBackground')
beerliking <- read_excel('DatasetRbook.xlsx',sheet = 'BeerLiking')

```

The packages you need to run the analyses are activated with the library function and the package name. If the package is not installed, please do this first:

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(tidyverse)

data("beercata")
beercata %>% head()
str(beercata)
table(beercata$Beer) 
length(unique(beercata$Consumer.ID))

```

From the above functions, you can see the data structure. Using the str() function will give you all the variable names. The lentgh() function is counting the number of participants as we have asked for the Consumer.ID variable in the dataset beercata.

## Two versions of the data

For analyses of CATA data, we need to versions of the data:

-   Raw data (binary, 0/1) with each row being responses from one evaluation (beercata dataset)
-   Agglomerated to counts, with each row being one product


```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#[Put in the pictures from Rinnan et al 2015]
# Questions we want answer using these data
# - Are the products different / similar? 
  # - Which attributes drives discrimination? 
  # - Are there any judges who are really of? 
```

The agglomerated version of the counts is computed by:

```{r, message=FALSE}
beercatasum <- beercata %>% 
  gather(attrib, val, S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %>% 
  group_by(Beer,attrib) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n = sum(val)) %>% 
  spread(attrib,n)

beercatasum
```

We call our new dataset *beercatasum*. Gather all the variables from *S_Flower* to *S_Vinous* and call them *attrib*. Group all data by the *Beer* variable (sample name column) and *attrib* (all of our CATA variables), then sum up the values (val) and call them *n*. Make a table of *attrib* and *n*. Save it all as the new name *beercatasum*. Then finally shown us the new data set.

... and visualized by for instance a barplot.

```{r}
# summary counts over attribute
beercatasum %>% 
  gather(attrib, n, S_Aromatic:S_Warming) %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = attrib, y = n, fill = Beer)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) + 
  coord_flip()
```

To plot all attributes, we need a long data format (discussed in more detail in chapter 1 in the section [Edit using Tidyverse]). *gather* creates the long format, which is then added as the first input in the plot (represented by "."). The different attributes are depicted on the x-axis, with the summed up values grouped by beer-type on the y-axis. The last line (coord_flip()) flips the plot, to make the attributes more readable.

For more plot types go to the Chapter on [Plotting data].

## Cochran's Q test

Cochran's Q test is a statistical test for the comparison of several products, where the response is binary, and there is repeated responses across several judges. We need the package **RVAideMemoire**.The data needs to be structured as the *beercata* is.

We can only run the model independently for one variable at a time.

For one response variable: *S_Flowers*

```{r}
library(RVAideMemoire)
m <- cochran.qtest(S_Flowers ~ Beer | Consumer.ID,
                   data = beercata)

m
```

The p.value is strongly significant, indicating that we cannot assume the same level of S_Flower in all beers. I.e. the beers seems different based on this characteristics. This is in agreement with the barplot above, where S_Flower is high in NY Lager and really low for Brown ale.

But in reality we only know that the beers are different overall, not which specific beers that are different. For this we need at post hoc test.

### Post hoc test

As we observe differences based on this attribute, we pursue the question on which products stick out? And are there products which are similar? This is done by pairwise comparisons, for this we need the package *rcompanion*:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rcompanion)
PT <- pairwiseMcnemar(S_Flowers ~ Beer | Consumer.ID,
                     data   = beercata,
                     test   = "permutation",
                     method = "fdr",
                     digits = 3)
PT$Pairwise %>% 
  arrange(-abs(as.numeric(Z))) %>% 
  data.frame()
```

The first part of the code is conducting the Post hoc test, whereas the last part of the code sorts the table from highest to lowest numerical value of Z. This is done to ease the interpretation of the table.

Most products are significantly different, while *Porse Bock* and *Ravnsborg Red* are fairly alike. This is determined by looking at the adjusted p-value, and checking whether it is exceed the desired $$\alpha$$-level. The adjusted p-values are used, as they have been adjusted to compensate for the fact that multiple pairwise comparisons are conducted.

### For all attributes in one run (nice to know)

We use the packages *tidyverse* and *broom* for this, but need a function capable of handling Cochran's Q-test outputs.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(broom)
tidy.RVtest <- function(m){
  r <- data.frame(statistic = m$statistic,df = m$parameter,
                  p.value= m$p.value,
                  method = m$method.test)
  return(r)
}

tb_cochran <- beercata %>% 
  gather(attrib, val, S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %>% 
  group_by(attrib) %>%
  do(cochran.qtest(val ~ Beer | Consumer.ID,
                   data = .) %>% tidy)

tb_cochran %>% 
  arrange(p.value) 
```

Again the table is sorted with the most sigficant at the top, and the least significant at the bottom. This output indicates that *S_Beans* is the most discriminatory attribute, while *S_Pungent* is the least.

For the pairwise comparisons, please apply the code for the Tukey test above per attribute.

## PCA on CATA data

For an introduction PCA, please go to the Chapter [Introduction to PCA and multivariate data] in the first part of the book.

A PCA on the summed CATA counts will reveal the attributes associated with the individual products:

```{r}
mdlPCA <- prcomp(beercatasum[,-1], scale. = T)
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, labels = beercatasum$Beer)
```

The figure shows the scores (beers, in black) and loadings (sensory descriptors, dark red) from the PCA's first two components. These two components describe 45.5% + 27.2% = 72.7% of the total variance in the summed data.

From the positions of the beers it is clear that the beers are similar in three pairs -- *Brown Ale* and *Ravnsborg Red*, left side of panel: *Porse Bock* and *River Beer*, upper right side; *NY Lager* and *Wheat IPA*, lower right part of panel. The sensory descriptors *S_Beans*, *Dried fruit*, *Caramel*, *Warming*, *Aromatic* etc. are all is associated to the beer *Brown ale*, while *Berries*, *Herb_Savory*, *Dessert*, *Pungent* etc. is characteristic for *Wheat IPA*, and to some degree also *NY Lager*. *Sour* and *Sparkling* are the two descriptors that are most frequently mentioned for *River Beer* and also *Porse Bock*.

You can check the analysis by cross checking with the summed CATA table.

Descriptors that are located very close to each other show very similar patterns of response, i.e. they are highly correlated. An example is *Caramel* and *Warming*, which do not have same summed scores but the same pattern of high and low across samples.

From the figure we can extract the overall conclusion of similarity and differences among samples, but we need Cochran's Q to describe which descriptors that can be used to statistically separate the samples, and which samples are different for said descriptor.

# Hedonic rating (e.g. liking scores)

An evaluation of how much we like a food or drink is a hedonic response. Often this is given as a number on a scale, or by checking a category box with a description, such as the 9-point hedonic scale. For data analysis, the boxes are made numerical, with the assumption the there is equidistance between the meaning of the category labels, i.e dislike extremely and dislike very much is as different as dislike a little and neutral. The original English language anchors for the 9-point hedonic scale was develop and validated on tests using approximately 5500 American soldiers in the beginning of the 1950's (Lawless & Heymann, Chapter 7 Scaling, 2010). There are a number of validated scales, including visual smiley scales for children. Dependent on the respondent 5, 7 or 9 point scales are used.

Most often we want to know if the hedonic response is significantly different (not just different by chance) depending on the samples. We might also want to know if other factors have an influence on the hedonic rating. e.g. household income or sex. We also want to know what are the actual differences are in numerical size. All this requires different statistical estimates.

## Plotting liking scores

For the beer data we have the liking in a long matrix.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(ggplot2)
data(beerliking)
```

A histogram of the likings shows that some are symmetric ( *NY Lager*, *River Beer* and to some extend *Porse Bock*), while *Brown Ale* and *Ravnsborg Red* is skeew, and *Wheat IPA* is uniform.

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Liking)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~Beer)
```

### PCA of hedonic ratings

PCA is a nice tool to get overview of structure in data. Here we
explicitly are interested in hedonic liking of the 6 beer types, and
whether there are certain beer-drinker profiles, such as some prefer
dark beer, while others like wheat or pilsner.

The liking data is in long format, and as we want to see correlation
between different beers we need to wrap the liking into wide format,
this can be done using **spread** from tidyverse. Further, there is
incomplete liking data, and here we only sustain hedonic answers from
consumers with all *6* liking answers. This filter can be computed in
different ways, here **drop_na()** is used.

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(tidyverse)
data("beerliking")

xbeerliking <- beerliking %>% 
  spread(Beer,Liking) %>% # make into wide format
  drop_na()
```

PCA is computed on the liking columns of this matrix

```{r}
mdlPCA <- prcomp(xbeerliking[,13:18])
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA)
```

Those who like *Ravnsborg red* also likes *NY Lager* and to some extend *Brown ale*, while *Porse Bock* and *Wheat IPA* also attracts the same consumers.

In general there is a trend towards all liking score being positively correlated, meaning, that costumers overall like (or dis like) beer. This can both be a real phenomena, but also an artifact of the consumers not using the scale in a similar fashion. It is a very common phenomena for sensory and hedonic data.

We can glue on demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, etc.,
as well as questions on interest in food and beer on this figure to
understand the consumer population.

```{r}
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = xbeerliking$Gender, ellipse = T)
```

```{r}
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = factor(xbeerliking$`Beer knowledge`), ellipse = T)
```

In general, the classical demographics do not relate to liking patterns,
as shown by gender above. Try the others to confirm.

For interest in food and beer there are patterns. One example is the
*Beer knowledge* with higher liking scores for more beer knowledge.
Similar intuitive patterns can be seen for some of the other
characteristics.

## Simple mixed models

In the following plot each liking score is connected within consumer across the beer types. The facet (according to Age) is just to avoid overplotting.

Here, there is a trend towards, if you rate one beer high, the other likings within that consumer will also be high.

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Beer,Liking, group = Consumer.ID, color = Consumer.ID)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  facet_wrap(~Age)
```

Mixed models are used when there is repetitions in the response due to
(here) the person tasting more than one product.

To fit a mixed model, we do the following:
First, we load the packages *lmerTest* and *lme4*, using *library()*. These packeges are used for fitting linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models in R.

Then, we fit the model: `mdl <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID))` 
This line fits a linear mixed-effects model to the data in the object `beerliking`. The formula `Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID)` specifies the model structure: 
- `Liking` is the response variable (dependent variable). 
- `Beer` is a predictor variable (independent variable) representing different types of beer. 
- `(1|Consumer.ID)` specifies a random intercept for each unique value of `Consumer.ID`. 
This accounts for potential variability between different consumers that may affect the liking score. 
- The resulting model is stored in the object `mdl`.

`summary(mdl)` generates a summary of the linear mixed-effects model stored in the object `mdl`. This summary contains a lot of information, but we are mainly interested in the information regarding the random effects, as we will look at the fixed effects at a later stage of the analysis. (This is because the information about the fixed effects in this summary is conducting t-test based on the order of the data, which we do not want to do).

When looking at the `Random effects`, we see that the residual uncertainty (`Std.Dev.`) is $1.63$ on the 1-7 Likert scale, while the uncertainty between consumers is $0.57$. This implies that the uncertainty between two ratings is higher when from two different consumers, compared to two ratings from the same consumer.

```{r}
library(lmerTest)
library(lme4)
mdl <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID)) 
summary(mdl)
```

We can use this model to evaluate the effect of the different beers, using the *anova*-function. 

This yields a p-value far below the significance level (`Pr(>F) = 1.175e-07`), and suggests that the average liking is different for at least 2 of the different beers. To investigate how they are all different compared to each other, we continue with some post hoc tests.

```{r}
anova(mdl)
```

### Post hoc test

The overall anova result implies that the 6 beers are *NOT* equal in
terms of liking, but some may be similar.

This can be investigated by computing pairwise contrasts using the *multcomp* package, using what is called Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (Tukey HSD).

To calculate pairwise comparisons between e.g. samples and find
letter-based representation you need a the package *multcomp*, and the pairwise comparison is conduted as follow:

- `mdl` is the model that we defined in the above part of the chapter, explaining the relationship between Liking and Beer(-type).
- `glht()` is a function from the `multcomp` package that stands for "general linear hypothesis test." It is used to perform hypothesis tests and obtain confidence intervals for linear combinations of model parameters. In this case, we're specifying the linear function using the `linfct` parameter.
- `mcp(Beer = "Tukey")` is defining the multiple comparison contrast. Here we specify, that we are interested in comparing means related to the variable `Beer` using Tukey's method. 

We then visualize the pairwise comparison in two different ways:
- `summary()` is used to obtain a summary of the results of the hypothesis tests. Here, all the pairwise comparisons are shown, with confidence intervals as well as adjusted p-values for each pairwise comparison.

- `cld()` is used to create what is called a compact letter display (CLD), which is a neat way of showing which groups are significantly different from each other. Samples with the same letters are not significantly different. 

Here, we can see, that Brown Ale has scored significantly higher than Wheat IPA, since they have been assigned with c and a respectively. But the Brown Ale is not significantly different from the Ravnsborg Red, as they both have been assigned with aâs.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(multcomp)

summary(glht(mdl, linfct = mcp(Beer = "Tukey")))

cld(glht(mdl, linfct = mcp(Beer = "Tukey")))
```

## Multivariable models

In the example above, only the impact of the different beers is
evaluated, however, the liking scores may also depend on background
information such as gender, age, ... as well as attitude towards beer
and food. Further, is there any of the background variables that
attenuate or make the differences between the beers stronger? These
questions can be investigated by models including several explanatory
variables as well as interaction terms.

### Additive models

This can be included in the models as a sequence of explanatory
variables.

Given a set of possible explanatory variables, there is two ways to
include them in the model.

**Forward step-wise Selection** and **Backward Step-wise Elimination**.

For both, the principle is simple and intuitive.

In the forward procedure each variable is added to the model, and the
strongest one (in terms of the lowest p-value) is kept.

In the backward procedure all variables are added to the model and the
least important one (in terms of the largest p-value) is removed.

Both procedures stop when the model is not going to improve by adding or
eliminating explanatory variables, and the final model will only contain
the significant variables.

In the beer dataset we would like to know which of the explanatory
variables are related to liking the most.

A large model with all explanatory variables is constructed

```{r}
mdl_be <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + Gender + Age + Income + 
                 Householdsize + `Beer types/month` + `Interest in food` + 
                 neophilia + `Interest in beer` + `Beer knowledge` + 
                 `Ingredients/labels` + `Future interest in beer` + 
                 (1|Consumer.ID)) 
anova(mdl_be)
```

From this, *Interest in food* is the least significant one (`Pr(>F) = 0.940561`), and is hence removed.

A sequential removal of the non-significant variables at a $p > 0.1$
level leads to the following model:

```{r}
mdl_be_red <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer +  Age + Income + 
                 `Beer types/month` + `Beer knowledge` + 
                  `Future interest in beer` + 
                 (1|Consumer.ID)) 
anova(mdl_be_red)
```

The results can be interpreted from the estimates:

```{r}
summary(mdl_be_red)
```

Some notes: Liking is higher in the lowest *Income* group, Liking is
lower in the lowest age group, and liking is higher with higher *Future
interest in beer*.

### Effect modification and Interactions

It could be nice to calculate if the liking of specific sample are
affected by the degree of future interest in beer. This can be
visualized as scatterplots and modelled using interactions.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(lmerTest)
ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(`Future interest in beer`, Liking, color = Beer)) + 
  geom_point() + stat_smooth(se = F, method = lm)

mdl_interaction <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer*`Future interest in beer` +  (1|Consumer.ID)) 

anova(mdl_interaction)

```

Although the slopes appear a bit different between the beers this is not
significant ($p = 0.12$). **Be aware** that it appears as the main
effect of beer is not significant. However, this value should not be
interpreted, as there are interaction terms in the model including beer.

Remember you choose your own "name" for the model "+" between variables defines (additive) main effects ":" between variables defines an
interaction "\*" between variables defines a parameterization with both interaction and main effect terms

For model selection here, you start by removing the interaction with the hight p-value and then recalculate the model. You cannot remove a main effect term if an interaction term which includes it is significant.

<!--chapter:end:14_HedonicRating.Rmd-->

# CATA and Hedonics

Certain attributes like floral is wanted in beer, while others may be unwanted, and hence detection of these attributes can have hedonic impact. This analysis can be evaluated for each attribute separately or all collectively using PCA. 

These data appears as two separate dataset, and hence need to be joint: 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(tidyverse)
data("beercata")
data("beerliking")
xbeer <- beerliking %>% 
  left_join(beercata, by = c('Beer','Consumer.ID'))
```

## Individual attributes and liking

### An example with Refreshing

```{r}
ggplot(data = xbeer, aes(Beer,  Liking, fill = factor(S_Refreshing))) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
```

From this plot it seems as if checking of the attribute _Refreshing_ leads to higher liking score. 
Further, this is even more so for light-colored beers like _Wheat IPA_ and _Porse Bock_. 

A model capturing this phenomena could be a linear model with interactions: 

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
mdl <- lmer(data = xbeer, Liking~factor(S_Refreshing)*Beer + (1|Consumer.ID))
anova(mdl)

```
All terms are significant and we are interested in the individual beer effects. We re-parametrice the model by removing the intercept (adding -1 at the end of the formula) and not including the main effect of S_Refreshing (change * to : in interaction, and add Beer as main effect). 

```{r}
mdl <- lmer(data = xbeer, Liking~Beer + factor(S_Refreshing):Beer + (1|Consumer.ID) - 1)
summary(mdl)
```

Here we see that the attribute will increase the liking by $0.7$ points for _Brown Ale_ and up to $2.4$ points for _Wheat IPA_. 

### All attributes

We can visualize for all attributes: 

```{r, fig.height=9}
g1 <- xbeer %>% 
  gather(cata, val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(Beer,  Liking, fill = factor(val))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 79, hjust = 1), legend.position = 'bottom') + 
  facet_wrap(~cata, ncol = 4)
g1 
```

For each attribute an interaction model will be used to qualify further analysis. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(broom)
library(broom.mixed)
tb <- xbeer %>% 
  gather(cata, val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %>% 
  group_by(cata) %>% 
  do(lmer(data = ., Liking~factor(val)*Beer + (1|Consumer.ID)) %>% anova %>% tidy)
```

This table has both main effect of the beer and cata-attribute as well their interaction. 

This print out shows the attributes related to liking - overall. 

```{r}
tb %>% 
  filter(term=='factor(val)') %>% 
  arrange(p.value)
```

The strongest ones are S_Refreshing, S_Sour, etc. while the presence of S_Warming, S_Pungent etc. has no effect on liking. 

```{r}
tb %>% 
  filter(term=='factor(val):Beer') %>% 
  arrange(p.value) %>% 
  head(6)
```

This table shows that S_Refreshing, S_Fruity, etc. has differential impact on the liking dependent on the beer it is detected in. 

A deep dive into the effect can be done using the setup with a single variable above using the _tidyverse_ and _broom_ framework. 

```{r}
tb2 <- xbeer %>% 
  gather(cata, val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous) %>% 
  group_by(cata) %>% 
  do(lmer(data = ., Liking~Beer + factor(val):Beer + (1|Consumer.ID) - 1) %>% tidy(conf.int = T))

```

```{r}
tb2 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(term,'factor')) %>%  # filter to get individual beer differences. 
  filter(cata %in% tb$cata[tb$term=='factor(val):Beer' & tb$p.value<0.05]) %>% # include only interesting ones. 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(substr(term,5,14), estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar() + facet_wrap(~cata) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 79, hjust = 1)) + 
  xlab('Beer')
```

The interpretation is that detecting _Smoked_ in e.g. _Ravnsborg Red_ tends to be positive, while it is pretty bad in _Wheat IPA_. 
Similarly, _Fruity_ is related to higher liking in _Wheat IPA_ and _Porse Bock_ but a bad thing in _River Beer_. 
_Nutty_ only matters on liking in _Ravnsborg Red_ and _River beer_. 

## PCA on CATA and Liking

A PCA on the agglomerated CATA counts including the liking will reveal the attributes associated with the individual products, and which attributes are correlated with the liking.  

```{r}
xbeeragglom <- xbeer %>% 
  gather(cata, val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous, Liking) %>% #looong format for all variables
  group_by(Beer,cata) %>% # summarize for each beer type
  dplyr::summarise(yy = mean(val, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  spread(cata,yy) # wide format
```

```{r}
mdlPCAcataliking <- prcomp(xbeeragglom[,-1], scale. = T)
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(mdlPCAcataliking, labels = xbeeragglom$Beer)
```



The attributes Bean, Caramel, Warming, Aromatic etc is associated to the beer _Brown ale_, while Berrie, Dessert, Pungent, etc. is characteristic of _Wheat IPA_. Further, _Liking_ is associated with all attributes on the first component, such as Aromatic, Warming, etc. 

### A beer centric model 

The above PCA shows general good- and bad attributes in terms of liking. However, the univariate analysis indicated that for some beers e.g. Smoked was a good thing while for others not so much. 

For that reason we can build a PCA for each beer to see which attributes that drives liking 

```{r}
xbeer <- xbeer[complete.cases(xbeer),]
PCAmdl_RR <- prcomp(xbeer[xbeer$Beer=='Ravnsborg Red',14:41], scale. = T)
ggbiplot::ggbiplot(PCAmdl_RR)
```

Caramel, Savoury spices and Reefreshing is promoting liking, while Sour is not. 


```{r, eval=F, include=FALSE}


[skulle meget gerne vise hvad der driver liking, ved godt PLS er bedre her, men det nÃ¥r vi ikke i Ã¥r. ydermere har de studerende heller ikke PCA fÃ¦rdigheder nÃ¥r de kommer til os, sÃ¥ det bliver alt for meget for dem med flere metoder....]

## Analysis by PLS

The data used in this section is from the paper: *Giacalone, Davide,
Wender L.P. Bredie, and Michael Bom FrÃ¸st. "'All-In-One Test' (AI1): A
Rapid and Easily Applicable Approach to Consumer Product Testing." Food
quality and preference 27.2 (2013): 108--119. Web.*. Data can be found
in the *data4consumerscience-package* as **beercata**, **beerliking**

### PLS basics

Partial Least Squares regression (PLS) is a linear regression approach
that shares similarities with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as
data is decomposed using latent variables. In the case of PLS there are
two matrices: predictors($\boldsymbol{X}$) and
response($\boldsymbol{Y}$). The X-matrix is used to predict the
Y-matrix. For both matrices the scores and loadings and resiudals are
computed:

$$X = TP^T + E_x$$ $$Y = UQ^T + E_y$$

PLS orient latent variables to optimize covariance between X-scores
($\boldsymbol{T}$) and Y-scores ($\boldsymbol{U}$), overcoming
limitations of traditional Multiple Linear Regression, such as handling
cases where variables outnumber observations or when X-variables are
mutually correlated.

### PLS to predict liking based on CATA data

The object of this section is to find which descriptors e.g. sour, is
relevant for the liking, and which are irrelevant.

When dealing with CATA data, it's reasonable to anticipate a low
explained variance in the model due to the high degree of uncertainty
within the CATA data itself. This means that as PLS attempts to
distinguish information from noise, the noise will account for a large
amount of variation in the data.

As preparation for the PLS, the two datasets *beerliking* and *beercata*
is combined:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(data4consumerscience)
data("beerliking")
data("beercata")

#Merge the two datasets:
beer <- na.omit(left_join(beercata, beerliking, by = c("Consumer.ID", "Beer")))
```

A dataframe is created by merging the two previously mentioned datasets, by the function *left_join*, based on the common columns *Consumer.ID* and *Beer*. *na.omit* is used to remove rows containing missing values, as the PLS function to be used later on, can not handle missing values in the variables used.

The PLS model can be built with relative ease using the *mdatools*
package:

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(mdatools)
#Create the PLS object:
beerPLS <- pls(x = beer[,3:29],y = beer$Liking ,center = T,scale = F,ncomp = 10)

summary(beerPLS)
```

The *pls* function is used, and the predictors is put as the x-value,
i.e. the CATA variables in column 3 to 29. and the response i.e. liking. 
Both the y and x matrices are mean-centered, by specifying *center = T*, the *scale* argument specifies if the data should be Auto-scaled.
*ncomp* argument specifies how many components should be calculated - in this case 4.

The model gives a warning of no validation results found. This is
referring to the cross-validation that can be done, to find the optimal number of components needed to describe the optimal complexity of the model. Let us add cross-validation to the model:

```{r}
#Create the PLS object:
beerPLSCV <- pls(x = beer[,3:29],y = beer$Liking ,center = T,scale = F,ncomp = 10,cv = rep(rep(1:length(unique(beer$Consumer.ID)), each = 6), length.out = nrow(beer)))
```

The cross-validation used is specified in the *cv* argument. The
argument takes a vast majority of inputs. Perhaps the easiest to use is
Leave-One-Out cross-validation that is specified by *cv = 1*, but might
also leave to overoptimistic results. In this case we cross-validate
based on the consumer, i.e. we obtain a vector containing
1,1,1,1,1,1...155,155,155,155,155,155 corresponding to the 6-times each
consumer answered.

The summary function can be used to see various information about the
PLS model:

```{r}
summary(beerPLSCV)
```

The summary seems to think 2 components is the optimal amount.

Let us plot the RMSE and see if this correct:

```{r}
plotRMSE(beerPLSCV)
```

The increase in the RMSECV from components 2 to 3, seems to indicate
that the optimal number of components is indeed 2.

### Regression coefficients

In Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, a regression vector refers to
the set of coefficients that are used to model the relationship between
the predictor variables ($\boldsymbol{X}$) and the response variable
($\boldsymbol{Y}$). These coefficients define how much each predictor
variable contributes to predicting the response variable (in this case
liking).

The regression coefficients can easily be visualized using the
*mdatools* package:

```{r}
plotRegcoeffs(beerPLSCV,show.labels = T, show.ci = T, ncomp = 2)
```

The function *plotRegcoeffs* is used, and the PLS object is specified.
*show.labels = T* specifies the labels from $\boldsymbol{X}$ is printed
on the bars. *show.ci = T* specifies that the confidence interval is
displayed on the bars. *ncomp* specifies the component the regression
coefficents should be displayed for.

From the regression vector plot, it seems the attributes S_Sour, S_Herbs
and S_Regional_Spices significantly lowers the liking of the beers. The
attributes S-Refreshing, S_aromatic, S_caramel among others seems to
significantly increase the liking of the beers. In addition there are
irrelevant non-significant attributes (i.e. confidence interval crossing
0) such as S_foamy and S_Berries among many other attributes.

The significance of the attributes can also be displayed in a table with coefficients, t-values, p-values and confidence interval:

```{r}
summary(beerPLSCV$coeffs, ncomp = 2)
```

These results are in line, with the visual interpretation above.

There are many other interesting plot methods, which can be found here:
[mdatools.com](https://mdatools.com/docs/pls--plotting-methods.html)

## L-PLS

The data used in this section is from the paper: *Giacalone, Davide,
Wender L.P. Bredie, and Michael Bom FrÃ¸st. "'All-In-One Test' (AI1): A
Rapid and Easily Applicable Approach to Consumer Product Testing." Food
quality and preference 27.2 (2013): 108--119. Web.*. Data can be found
in the *data4consumerscience-package* as **beercata**, **beerdemo**,
**beerliking**

*L-PLS* is a valuable tool in identifying the sensory attributes and
consumer background characteristics that contribute to a consumer's
liking of a product, such as beer.

A L-PLS model is created using three data blocks: **X1**, **X2**, and
**X3**. **X1** is an IxN matrix that contains consumer liking scores for
each sample, X2 is an IxJ matrix that includes sensory attributes for
each sample, and X3 is a KxN matrix that comprises consumer background
data. I represents the number of samples (beer), N represents the number
of consumers, J represents the number of sensory variables, and K
represents the number of consumer background variables.

There are two ways to perform L-PLS: exo and endo. In the exo-LPLSR
model, X1 serves as the regressor, while in the endo-LPLSR model, X2 and
X3 are the regressors. The exo-LPLSR model typically explains more of X
than the endo-LPLSR model because the exo-LPLSR derives its bilinear
components from X, whereas the endo-LPLSR derives its components from Y
and Z. The difference in the plot's appearance can be predicted from the
explained variance of each model type.

If both plots are similar in nature and in terms of the interpretation
of the correlation loading plots, it may indicate consistent
co-variation between the three matrices.

The exo version will only be showcased here, but the principle is the
same, and endo can be useful for data exploration.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("beercata")
data("beerdemo")
data("beerliking")
```

##Creating X1, X2, X3.

The preparation of the data, requires quite a lot of data manipulation.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)

# Prepare data for LPLS analysis

## Y - Beer Liking data
X1 <- beerliking %>%
  select(Beer, Liking, Consumer.ID) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Consumer.ID, values_from = Liking) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Beer") %>%
  select_if(~!any(is.na(.)))

## X - Beer Attributes data
colnames(beercata) <- gsub("S_", "", colnames(beercata))
X2 <- beercata %>%
  select(Beer, Flowers:Vinous) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = !Beer, names_to = "Attribute", values_to = "Value") %>%
  group_by(Beer, Attribute) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Sum_value = sum(Value)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Attribute", values_from = "Sum_value", values_fill = 0) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Beer")

## Z - Consumer Demographics data
# select subset of columns and create binary columns for categorical variables
binary_cols <- c("Gender", "Age", "Income", "Householdsize", "Beer types/month")
for (col in binary_cols) {
  if (is.factor(beerdemo[[col]]) | is.character(beerdemo[[col]])) {
    levels <- unique(beerdemo[[col]])
    for (level in levels) {
      new_col <- paste(col, level, sep = "_")
      beerdemo[[new_col]] <- ifelse(beerdemo[[col]] == level, "1", "0")
    }
  }
}

# pivot longer and summarize to calculate sum values for each Consumer ID-Attribute combination
X3 <- beerdemo %>%
  select(-(Gender:`Beer types/month`),`Interest in food`:`Beer types/month_9 - 16`,`Consumer ID`) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-`Consumer ID`), 
            .funs = list(~as.factor(.) %>% as.numeric())) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols =`Interest in food`:`Beer types/month_9 - 16` , names_to = "Attribute", values_to = "Value") %>%
  group_by(`Consumer ID`, Attribute) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(sum_Value = sum(Value)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Consumer ID", values_from = "sum_Value", values_fill = 0) %>%
  column_to_rownames("Attribute")

# keep only columns in Y
col_names <- names(X1)
X3 <- X3[,col_names]

# LPLS function only accepts matrix. Convert data frames to matrices.
X1_mat <- as.matrix(X1)
X2_mat <- as.matrix(X2)
X3_mat <- as.matrix(X3)

```

##Building the model: The L-PLS model can be built, using the *lpls*
function from the *multiblock* package.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(multiblock)
set.seed(123)
#Scale the Z-matrix as we have semi-contious and binary data. 
lp_exo <- lpls(X1_mat,X2_mat,X3_mat,type = "exo",scale = c(F,F,T),doublecenter = T,ncomp = 5)
```

###Finding the explained variance for exo L-PLS

The explained variance for the exo L-PLS can easily be sacked from the
model object, and displayed nicely in a table using the *kableExtra*
package.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
expVarExo <- t(as.data.frame(lp_exo$vars)*100)
colnames(expVarExo) <- paste0("Comp ", 1:5)
rownames(expVarExo) <- paste0("X", 1:3)

#Create a table
kbl(expVarExo, caption = "Explained Variance by Component (%)",digits = 0) %>%
  kable_paper("hover",full_width = F)
```

The explained variance is first sacked from the L-PLS object, and stored
in a data-frame, from where it is transposed, and converted to
percentage (%). *kbl* function is then used to get a nice table.

From looking at the table, one would expect the consumer descriptors to
be close to origin in terms of scores. One could have a look at the endo
version of the L-PLS to get a better understanding of the consumer
descriptors.

###Cross-validation Next let us have a look how many components we
should look at, by doing a jack-knifing cross-validation on the
consumers:

```{r}
lp.cv2 <- lplsCV(lp_exo, segments2 = as.list(1:dim(X1)[2]))
lp.cv2$rmsep
```

It looks like 2 components is sufficient.

###Vizulization Now we would like to visuzlalize our L-PLS model. When
using L-PLS for vizulization one should use the orthognoal exo, as this
will give the orthogonal scores. We build the orthogonal exo in the same
way as before, but chainging the type.

```{r}
lp_exo_ort <- lpls(X1_mat,X2_mat,X3_mat,type = "exo_ort",scale = c(F,F,T),doublecenter = T,ncomp = 5)
```

Now we plot the L-PLS model. One can chose to plot, the X1, X2 or X3
correlations, or perhaps a combination of 2, or all.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lp_exo,doplot = c(F,F,T)) #X3 correlations
plot(lp_exo,doplot = c(F,T,F)) #X1 correlations
plot(lp_exo,doplot = c(T,T,F)) #X2 and X1 correlations
plot(lp_exo,doplot = c(F,T,T)) #X1 and X3 correlations
```

```{r}
plot(lp_exo,doplot = c(T,T,T)) #combined
```

From the plots, the sensory attribute *Berries* is correlated with the
sensory attribute *Herbs*. These two sensory attributes is in turn
correlated with the beer *River Beer*. In turn *River Beer* is opposite
of the beer *Brown Ale*, which seems to be very *Foamy*. In this case
our consumer background descriptors do not seem to explain a whole lot.
But it does seem like a young age *Age 18-25* is associated with a low
income (*Income 0-10.000*). Where a consumer of such description tends
to like *Porse Bock*.

It is always a good idea to confirm the observed correlations by
plotting the raw data. Lets have a look at some of them.

# Projective mapping

[An image of a PM]

## Example from mapping of XX 

```{r}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("tempetotemperature")
tempetotemperature
table(tempetotemperature$Productname)
table(tempetotemperature$Assessor)
```

This dataset consists of 9 products evaluateed by 11 judges. 
The responses is the 2D coordinates of the procetive mapping, for each judge individually (X1, Y1, X2,..., Y11), and CATA data on 30 attribues (Miso, Soft, Bitter,..., Stout).

# TFIH Exercises

Below you will find exercises relevant for the data analysis for the project work in the Thematic course in Food Innovation and Health. Exercises are meant as a guide on what you can do with your own data obtained through the practical work on the projects. 

Before you start to work on the exercises, you need to familiarize yourself with the knowledge in the introduction chapters of this book as well as the chapters written specifically of for this course. 


## Exercise 1: Descriptive statistics and plots

From this exercise you should be able to describe the products in terms of common, rare and differential attributes, as well as the hedonic ratings. 

### CATA counts

Create data set with CATA counts per product and make a table thereof

Plot the CATA counts such that product differences are emphasized. 

Which characteristics is most pronounced overall? And where are the largest product differences observed? 

```{r, eval = F}
library(data4consumerscience)
data("beercata")
```

### Hedonics 

Plot hedonic ratings (beerliking$Liking) per product in histograms to see the distribution

Calculate descriptive statistics for hedonic rating for each product. 

Which beer is in general more likable? Is the disagreement in liking similar across beers? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data("beerliking")
```

## Exercise 2: Consumer background and PCA

From this exercise you should be able to describe who your consumers are.

### Demographics 

Age, Gender, Income and Household size is classical demographic characteristics. As the evaluation of the products is done using a specific group of people, the generalizability of the results naturally condition of the characteristics of this population. 

Construct the distributions of the demographic characteristics. You can use the table() function, or maybe do it all at once using the **tableone** package. For inspiration, modify the code below to serve your needs. 

Is there any demographic bias in this dataset? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(data4consumerscience)
library(tableone)
data("beerdemo")

CreateTableOne(vars = c('Age','Gender'),data = beerdemo)
```

### PCA on _Interests_

Calculate a PCA model including the Variables 7 ( _Interest in food_ ) to 12 ( _`Future interest in beer`_ ). Remember to standardize/scale the variables

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mdlPCA <- prcomp(beerdemo[,7:12],scale. = T)
```

Plot the scores and loadings in a biplot and look for groupings of the consumers in the scores. 

Group and color according to the background information not used in the model (Gender, Age,..)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggbiplot)
ggbiplot(mdlPCA, groups = beerdemo$Gender, ellipse = T)
```

Describe what you find: 
For instance, is the loading making sense? 


## Exercise 3: PCA on CATA counts

From this exercise you should be able to describe your samples (beers) from the CATA counts, and which attributes that occur together, as well as which attribute patterns that discriminate products.  

Calculate a PCA model including all Variables and all Objects.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PCAmdl <- prcomp(beercata[,3:29], scale. = T)
```

Plot the scores and describe the groupings of the samples.

Plot the loadings and describe the correlations between the variables.

Both of these plots are present in a biplot, but you may want to play around with the settings (such as varname.size, varname.adjust, ...) to get all information out. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggbiplot(PCAmdl, groups = beercata$Beer, ellipse = T)
```

Use this biplot to find out which samples are described by which CATA attributes. as well as similarity of products.  

## Exercise 4: Cochranâs Q test on CATA binary data

In Exercise 1 the attributes characteristic for certain products, were summarized using descriptive stats and plots. Now we want to add statistical inference onto these observations. 

To get started, choose a few attributes. For each attribute 1) Perform Cochranâs Q test for overall difference, and if _interesting enough_ 2) perform a Post hoc test for product segmentation. 

To get all attributes analyzed collectively, use the _tidyverse_ code in the chapter [For all attributes in one run (nice to know)]. 

Which descriptors are most different between products? 
Are the overall most pronounced descriptors also the ones most different? 

Try this procedure out on a different dataset, e.g. the tempeto data. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data("tempetofermentation")
library(RVAideMemoire)
tempetofermentation$Product2 <- factor(tempetofermentation$Product) # needs to be a factor for getting labels on results.
m <- cochran.qtest(Sour ~ Product2 | Assessor,
                   data = tempetofermentation)
```


## Exercise 5: Hedonic ratings and consumer characteristics

From this exercise you should be able to describe the liking of the beer samples and glimpse into consumer characteristics related to liking

### PCA on joint data

Calculate a PCA model including all Variables and all Objects.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
include_these <- complete.cases(beerliking)
PCAliking <- prcomp(beerliking[include_these,-c(1:7)], scale. = T)
```

Plot a biplot or loading plot, and use the loadings and describe the correlations between the variables (liking of beers in this case).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggbiplot(PCAliking)
```


Plot the scores and describe the groupings of the samples by colouring the score plot according to the consumer background variables. Note that the 160 rows in both datasets match each-other, so we can glue the demo information directly onto the liking model. If that was not the case, matching using left_join() or inner_join() would be necessary before analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggbiplot(PCAliking,groups = beerdemo$Age[include_these], ellipse = T)
```

Any trends? For instance, how is liking related to the individual consumer diversity of beer ( _Beer types/month_)? 

### All demographics 

... Some code to get all 7-scale demo information plots. You may want to export and view in a pdf viewer for zooming etc.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gall <- cbind(PCAliking$x[,1:2], beerdemo[include_these,]) %>% 
  gather(var,val,`Interest in food`:`Future interest in beer`) %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(PC1,PC2, color = factor(val))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_ellipse() + 
  facet_wrap(~var)
ggsave(filename = 'anicebigfigure.pdf',gall, height = 20, width = 20)
```


## Exercise 6: PCA on CATA counts and hedonic ratings

From this exercise you should be able to conclude _what_ attributes that overall drives the liking of products (beers).

For each beer, the collated CATA counts and the averaged liking constitutes the multivariate response matrix.

```{r, eval = F}
likingsum <- beerliking %>%
  group_by(Beer) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(lik = mean(Liking, na.rm = T))

catasum <- beercata %>% 
  gather(attrib,val,S_Flowers:S_Vinous ) %>% 
  group_by(Beer,attrib) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mn = mean(val, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  spread(attrib,mn)
```


Join the two. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cata_lik <- catasum %>% left_join(likingsum, by = 'Beer')
```

Do a PCA 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PCAcata_lik <- prcomp(cata_lik[,-1],scale. = T)
ggbiplot(PCAcata_lik, labels = cata_lik$Beer)
```
What charaterizes _River Beer_ ? 
Which descriptors are in general associated with liking? (and dis-liking?)


## Exercise 7: Mixed modelling on hedonic ratings

In this exercise we want to model _Liking_ as a response. We want to use the beer type as the main predictor, but take into account that the responses is repeated within consumers. The same judges have evaluated all beers. This is a mixed model

Start with a plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = beerliking, aes(Beer, Liking)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
lik_mdl <- lmer(data = beerliking, Liking ~ Beer + (1|Consumer.ID))
```

Evaluate this model by anova() and summary(), and interpret the result. How much within individual consumer variation is there compared to between consumer? 

You should get that the beers are not equally likable. But are there maybe some which are more similar? 
Perform a all-pairs post hoc test and try to group beers based on liking. 

```{r, eval=F}
library(multcomp)
summary(glht(lik_mdl, linfct = mcp(Beer = "Tukey")), 
        test = adjusted("fdr"))
```

Try to add consumer demographics and interest to the model to evaluate general consumer patterns as well as interactions with beer type. 

Try to answer questions such as: 

 * Are there any significant product differences for the liking? If so, what does the post hoc test tell us? How does this fit with what you have done in the PCA exercises. 
 * Is the liking in general affected by the age, gender, household size or beer knowledge? What is the effect? Try to think of a plot that can show the significant differences.
 * Do men and women score the samples significantly different in liking? Calculate the sample/gender differences in averages.
